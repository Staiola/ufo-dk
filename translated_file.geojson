        "content": "One summer morning in 1975 or 1976, my father and I were driving from our home. He had to go to work, and I had to be dropped off at the school bus where Vesterskovvej meets Skamlingvej. Therefore, the time must have been between 7.30 and 8.00. The sun had risen, it was windless with a few high-lying clouds. The object remained - completely without moving - in front of us for 3-5 minutes. I later talked to my father about how we had the feeling that &quot;it&quot; was as aware of our existence as the other way around. We didn&#39;t talk or move (unless it was their freezing rays that paralyzed us :-)) while the observation was taking place. After this period, the object flew away in a long circular arc to the southeast, towards Sdr. Bjert strand/Skamlingsbanken. It was a long and steady acceleration, and when the object disappeared from view it was perhaps 10 kilometers away. At the time, it was moving far faster than any jet plane. So there are many reasons not to review this after so many years; the ufo completely sticks to a design from a sci-fi film from the 50s, and I was, as it appears from personal data, 7 or 8 years old, when you have a considerable power of imagination. If I had seen it alone, I would surely have repressed the memory as fantasy. But now there were two of us who saw it and could confirm each other. And the weather was amazingly clear and the observation lasted a long time. And it is probably quite far out in the country, but it was a little after 8 o&#39;clock, and there must have been many people up and on their way to work who may have seen something. The experience was fantastic, and it is actually mostly a fond memory, but it would add another dimension if others had also experienced something... So if you have time, as I said, it would be exciting. I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t give you the exact date, but we lived in the area until I started 3rd grade and that&#39;s the closest I can get - my mom doesn&#39;t remember either. I remember the minutes themselves vividly. I have sent you a Google Earth map pin of the place we got out of the car.",

        "content": "It has now been many years, but it is an experience I will never forget. We were 5 friends who were going to a prom in Jelling. We had agreed to meet at one of them for a beer before we left. We meet at the friend&#39;s place approx. 8 p.m. I didn&#39;t have any beer with me, so a classmate and I agreed to go down to the Statoil tank, which is located at the intersection. The house where we were is located next to the local sports field, and therefore we just wanted to slip over it to take a shortcut. When we were halfway across the football field, I spotted something strange in the sky. Directly above our heads was a silver oval shaped object. It was darkened, but there was glare from street lights or the like. I stopped and asked my companion what it was. We quickly agreed that it wasn&#39;t a plane or anything like that. The object was silent. After observing the object for approx. 5 minutes we went on. After walking a few meters we became aware that the object was moving in the same direction as we were walking. We stopped again, as did the object. We looked for a min. or two. After the object has moved, I will shoot the distance to approx. 200-800 meters. We had now become so insecure about the situation that we set off and went down and bought our beer. When we had done our shopping, we went back the same way. We looked up at the sky again, but now the object was gone. We continued back to the other comrades and told the story. It has been many years, but it has left its mark.",

If it had been a plane, the sound from these would have been clear. I live high up, and at this time of the day it is completely quiet. The three objects flew at a distance seen as the crow flies of approx. 1000 meters, respectively calmly or at a moderate speed across the sky, after which it appeared as if they fell towards the ground and then rose to a level that was higher than the first observed, they were not followed in parallel, as one suddenly rose and disappeared east over. The others followed a parallel line and also disappeared to the east. I can&#39;t see them further than about 100 meters to the east, as our roof covers the further view. I have been in the Air Force, and have never in my time seen anything that could be mistaken for what I saw. They could not be mistaken for a plane/helicopter or other flying object that I know of.

        "content": "A red light that pulsated to almost white with a steady 5-10 second cycle hovered over the sea for approx. 100 m height (we stood at about 40 m height) and saw the light above the horizon). The speed was steady, but too fast to be a blowing balloon. It was almost windless. There was no sound. The light disappeared behind a mountain forest after a minute. Immediately afterwards we spotted another red-white pulsating light moving along the coast. At once I took it for a red lantern on a speeding boat, but then the light rose into the air until it was at the same height as the first and disappeared in the same direction. After a few minutes, similar pulsating lights were seen at the same height, but now in the opposite direction and many kilometers away on their way away. We lost sight of it as it got further away. Spoke the next day with the military ship observers on Røsnæs lighthouse, but they had not been on duty. There were no official flights in the logbook. My best &quot;non-alien&quot; guess is that it could have been some small multi-rotor electric helicopters. However, this type hardly has such a long flight time, so the owner must have lost them when we went home after an hour&#39;s wait. Not likely that anyone would sacrifice two such precious toys like that. Seems to fall into the same category as what many others have observed in recent months.",

When the light disappeared behind the house roof, I ran in for binoculars and further around behind the house on the south side to continue the observation. The object&#39;s direction had then changed to southeast. I climbed a ladder by our garden shed to get an unobstructed view and observed the object through binoculars until it disappeared behind the trees on the hills on the horizon. In the binoculars I could see a clear layering in the colors that the object now emitted. Green at the top, yellow in the middle and red at the bottom. The top, or top, was rounded in shape, the underside more uneven with what looked like two bulges sticking out below. When I went back inside it was 2:46 am.",

It got my attention because it wasn&#39;t flashing like they usually do, and it was louder than usual, but it was high up, and there was no sound from it, but it wasn&#39;t something that I considered unexplainable, just a little weird. So I got into my car and drove out of the area I live in, but I didn&#39;t get more than 800m down the road when another red light appeared. This time there were two very powerful red lights. They flew very close and they were closer to the ground. I got out of my car and took a picture of my sighting. Again there was no sound. At first I thought hot air balloons, but they were too fast. They came into view in the north and flew in a straight line to the south. At first it looked like one was flying in a straight line behind the other When they had flown some distance past me it looked like the rear red light was flying up the side of the other. I have no logical explanation as to what it was I saw. I have ruled out helicopters, airliners, hot air balloons and laser lights. I&#39;ll bet they were moving at a speed of 200 km per hour. I hope there are others who can confirm my story, or there is a reasonable explanation.",

Therefore, I was probably paying more attention to the sky than I usually am. My first thought was airplanes, but there were no wings and there were no rotor blades or other aerodynamic details to be seen. The object was a round silhouette against the sky. No sounds could be heard from rotor blades and a helicopter is not round. The object moves with approx. 500 km/h a gliding motion, stops without deceleration, continues in the same direction again without normal acceleration, stops abruptly again, stands still for a moment, and is suddenly no longer visible. I have thought a lot about cognitive processes that could have caused an illusion, but must conclude that it was a large, round object, which could be seen as a silhouette, which moved in a way that no aircraft known to me can move on.",

They flew past our house/window. We had the window fully open, but it was completely quiet. No sound at all. After that there were again 2 equals. balls of light with the same speed, etc. I tried to spot them in the binoculars, a little difficult because of the darkness and its speed. I could see from the one that the equation. a half circle, and there was light all around it. Yes, it was very strange. Had actually seen 3 equals. 14 days ago one evening we had guests. They came from the same place/direction. We actually just sat there and joked that yes, it could look like a UFO.",

I saw a metallic spherical round object &quot;UFO&quot; flying relatively slowly across the sky at low altitude in a northerly direction. I would assess the object to have been max. 100 meters high in the air and headed towards a small white cloud. The object disappeared from view, flying below the cloud and then out of my field of vision. I am not sure about the size of the object, but a guess would be 1 meter in diameter. The sky was blue with a few small white clouds in the background. The sun&#39;s rays reflected in the object as if it were made of polished chrome. I tried to take pictures with my phone of the object, but unfortunately the object was already out of my field of vision. I also tried to record a video, but to my great chagrin, I later found out that I had not pressed the record button correctly, but since the object cannot be seen in the 2 pictures that I had already taken, there probably wouldn&#39;t have been anything to see on the video clip anyway, if it had come to anything!

The sun shines directly in my eyes, so I can&#39;t see it very clearly. I rush to find my sunglasses and turn on my iPhone to record the strange thing in the sky. By the time I do that, the &quot;thing&quot; has already moved far away from me. But, anyway, I recorded what I could and would love to send that recording to you. Maybe I just saw a black bag in the sky, but it was very strange to look at, it was making noise and moving right up above the sun.",

He can&#39;t explain what it is. We see it disappear, the light slowly going out as the distance lengthens. We turn and want to go inside. We then see two more in the same direction turning off just above our heads, very close we thought. I see through the binoculars that one&#39;s light goes out, but I can see its silhouette, still round and larger than the light, the other continues, but the one that is off and goes down behind some trees, close by. So we take the car and drive in the direction of the place, but see nothing.. It was not a plane, there was no sound. Very strange that the first two keep the same height and direction, strange that the last one goes down.",

Since, despite the city lights, it was completely starry in the part of the sky that can be seen from the yard, it was tempting to look back and try to recognize some of the constellations. Suddenly, from a point in the north-west direction, out of nowhere (from a point in the sky I was just watching) an oval object appears, where my immediate assumption was that it was a shooting star. Only when it disappeared behind our own roof in a south-westerly direction did I have doubts. The object had to be unusually large for a shooting star to be. Also, it hadn&#39;t disintegrated, and the thought that it might have been a larger meteor shooting down through the atmosphere struck me. I imagined that it could also be a plane or a helicopter after all, but no sound came from the object at any time. If it were a high-flying airliner, the relative speed across the sky would also be slower (just as the size of the object would be smaller). And if it was a jet plane or a helicopter, the speed would no less indicate engine noise. I remember the light intensity as being the same for the good 5 seconds the observation lasted, and the object could only be seen as star-colored white light, which was simply much larger than ordinary stars or shooting stars. I am immediately curious to hear if others have made a similar observation at the same time, if meteor impacts have actually been reported (on land or at sea), or if there are radar observations at the time of the observation that can tell us something.",

While it does this, it stands still, and so do all the others, also at the same time as the second-to-last also emits some blue light. They fly further south and disappear. It takes approx. 5 minutes, then more arrive, they all fly in the same direction, and all disappear to the south. There are still some who stop to throw away the blue light.

At first I think it must be a satellite - but due to the rather uneven speed and partly stopping - I take a closer look. Follows it all the way. It doesn&#39;t look like much and looks more like a star. When it suddenly turns around and flies towards the North/East (Orion&#39;s belt) it is strange. Cannot be a balloon, airplane (checked with Fligt radar) or satellite. No drone either - way too loud. My wife also comes out and looks and agrees that it looks strange.

It has no immediate extent. Since 248° is roughly in the direction of the setting sun from 240° to 245° in the time period - and in the same direction the incoming planes come from the west towards Kastrup Airport, it is most likely sunshine from a plane. However, I think that it was much quieter in the approx. 20 seconds, I observed, than the incoming planes usually do. If others have similar observations to mine, but from different angles, this observation will be interesting.",

This time was a little different, as I said there was cloud cover, and if it hadn&#39;t been because it was moving, I wouldn&#39;t have seen it. It was disc-shaped, gray (same color as the cloud) and flew quite low just below the cloud cover. It must have been relatively large, as I estimated from that distance that it was approx. 5-7 cm in diameter and enough wing approx. 2-3 kilometers from where I live. It flew at the speed of an F-16, which was quite slow and completely silent, it disappeared into a cloud and I saw no more of it.",

Just after dusk, some saw an orange glowing dot in the sky moving across the Frederiksberg Center. I don&#39;t know when it actually appeared. When I saw the dot, it was in a northerly direction, (I found the direction with a Kraks map and a pocket compass), for approx. 50-55 degree elevation. The dot was very clear and bright, no flashing or sound. It most resembled an emergency rocket. It moved slowly to the west as it slowly faded out, somewhat in the same way that airplanes can. Therefore, it seemed as if it was moving away from us. Eventually it faded out completely and was gone. There were many who saw the dot, and the reactions were very mixed. A few wondered, others were indifferent, and still others had an attitude in between.",

Unfortunately we have forgotten the date; but it was a very dark evening, and therefore certainly in the winter. The year can deceive us somewhat; but 1972, maybe 73 will be close. We stood in the dune and heard the roar of the sea, because you couldn&#39;t see the sea, it was actually pitch black. Suddenly, and it was actually quite sudden, a very strong light appeared, for me to see almost at the edge of the beach, my husband remembers the distance as approx. at the outer end of the built hips, however, we agree on the clarification to between hips 89 and 90; but closest to 90. The bright light appears in my memory as a round/oval-lying luminous ball with great radiant power - quite close to the ground or water surface. There was no movement. We don&#39;t remember the color; but to my inner eye I can recreate the image with red-yellow warm colors. My husband leans more towards the view that maybe the color was lighter to white. Whether the phenomenon was to be seen for 5 minutes is also difficult to assess today; but at least we don&#39;t think it was there anymore. AND. It is true that there was no light when we got to the sea. There were no sounds in connection with the observation. Waves only. And. There was absolutely no question of fishing boats or other natural phenomenon that simply landed. And, it wasn&#39;t about big waves either, which would be able to hide a larger ship between possible waves - in between. There was no wind at all that evening. We were greatly surprised by what we had seen, and have spoken many, many times since then about the episode, which we are still quite confused about. Even with our best approaches, we have never been able to come up with a single natural explanation for the phenomenon. As children born in -, and brought up next to the North Sea, we were both familiar with the phenomenon we call fire in the sea or fire in the sea, as it is probably also called. We have observed this several times both before and after the mentioned incident, which in no way resembles arson in the slightest. If our observations, even if they have been archived in our heads for many years, could be used in the investigation of UFOs, that would make us happy, and we would of course like to hear if you have an idea of what we could possibly do. in reality have seen. Today we are respectively 50 and 51 years old, and have talked about the episode as recently as today at afternoon coffee.",

As the object rotated, it appeared to have a pair of wings that bent down in a radius. Below that sat a lamp that flashed white, with a very soft light (not Xenon or LED). I used my 10x50 binoculars to observe, and it immediately looked like the object was hanging out over Nybøl Nor. But a drone that hangs mine. 1 hour pretty much the same place?? Who is performing? What secrets are there around Nybøl Nor? Some blurry and small pictures and video, unfortunately I couldn&#39;t zoom in enough, but you probably have the equipment for that.

Neither was there any sound other than the ordinary one in the street. Today, 11.10, I saw the same thing - also on the way to Brugsen. I got off the bike to find out what the hell this could be - again. As soon as I stopped, the stone did too. I decided that now it wasn&#39;t going to get away as easily as yesterday, when I had probably wondered what it could be, but hadn&#39;t really made the effort to look into it. After approx. 5 minutes when it had not moved out of the spot, I slowly drove on. I could now see that the object was following my movement, that it started at the same time as I started cycling again, and that it was following me in the same direction as I was cycling. Suddenly I saw something (today 11.10 on my way to the utility, and as last observed) which I had not noticed yesterday, namely that there was a tall antenna mast in the place where the object could be seen. I have to admit that my senses and my mind played tricks on me. What I saw was the anti-collision light on top of a transmission mast located just 100 meters from my cycle route. And then it is now afterwards, and you are not quite used to changing light patterns during the season. But of course: When I kept still, the light on the antenna mast naturally did too. Oh yes. When will I see a real flying saucer, one of those that just streaks across the sky like lightning?",

I was sitting out on my balcony with my girlfriend, and when we were sitting looking up at the stars, suddenly 10-15 &quot;lights&quot; &quot;flying things&quot; UFO-like things &quot;&quot; came flying over our heads (from behind) (east) ) and towards the road we were sitting.

        "content": "Last night, April 4, approx. at At 01:15 a good friend and I were sitting at Nivå harbor talking in his car and looking at the stars. It was windless, the sky was completely cloudless and there were no city lights, so it was very starry. The car was parked on a small pier (about 1 m. above sea level) that had the shape of a large semicircle. It was very dark, so you could only see the silhouette of the pier, and the silhouette of a trash can, which was the only object on the pier. Looking out towards the pier, I saw something utterly surreal. Right out at the edge of the pier approx. 20 meters ahead, I could see a silhouette of an indescribable shape, &quot;blinking&quot; and flitting back and forth in an area of approx. 3 meters. It was on for about 7 seconds. The form now turned into a small figure bent forward (about 160 cm), moving at the same speed as a human walking very fast. The figure moved approx. 7 meters to the left and disappeared with one about 1 meter before it reached the bin. Of course, I sat completely speechless and shaken, and looked like a big question mark. My friend and I agreed that we had observed the same thing. However, he had seen something bright dome-like 5 meters in front of the car, just before the second observation had taken place. It must be said that we also saw a shooting star for a few minutes. before the sighting of the dark figures. I will never forget what I saw last night.",

A few seconds later I realize that there is not much wind, that it could be a bag and go back a little to be able to see it better, I then realize that it is something completely different, and not something I&#39;ve seen before. I look at the object, which is saucer-shaped and the color is almost gray-white. It passes almost straight over my head without a sound and without any kind of light. It moves out towards Køge Bay at a steady speed that did not seem to be particularly high, approx. 150-200 km/h. However, I am not sure of this, as I did not have the opportunity to see how high up it was and therefore cannot say how big it was either. I could see it for approx. 10 seconds before it disappeared out of sight as silently as it had appeared. This is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen anything so incredible, and I think my lower jaw almost hit the pavement, I was gaping so much, while also feeling a little uneasy about not knowing what was flying overhead head on me.",

        "content": "During a family birthday, we observe a larger object in the night sky south of Fredensborg, the object is stationary and changes between green, red, yellow, etc. somewhat like a star, but clearly larger than any known stars. We set up Leica binoculars to examine the object more closely, but it is initially difficult to focus on, however we can rule out with some certainty that it should be a star, a plane or a helicopter. The object changes after approx. 4-5 min color to completely yellow/white and grows considerably, then disappears at considerable speed towards Sweden. We also believe that the object was followed by a smaller and weaker object, and here we think it is a plane or similar. During the next hour, we observe a few more objects, which, however, glow shorter and &quot;just&quot; fade away. However, we can calmly rule out that it was something unique and &quot;foreign&quot; - this is not where we are looking for an explanation, but it would now be interesting to solve the mystery, or hear from others who may have seen the same. We&#39;ve kind of settled on the fact that it might be a stationary rocket, or some meteorological measuring equipment, but we are by no means experts in the field.",

        "content": "At approx. at quarter to one my girlfriend and I observed a large number of luminous and faintly reddish dots moving silently across the Copenhagen night sky. The phenomenon was most reminiscent of hot air balloons or the like. and initially the number was around 7-9 red dots. They moved at exactly the same (same for everyone) and constant speed across the horizon - corresponding to a movement from left to right in the night sky as seen from our kitchen window. As the first of the observed red dots disappeared from our field of vision, new ones appeared. In total, there have been approx. between 14 and 20 red dots that moved with this pattern. It took a total of approx. 6-7 minutes for all dots to move across the sky. We took many pictures and video clips with our mobile phones and digital camera, but they subsequently turned out not to contain anything useful. The equipment is probably too bad. However, for good measure we have preserved the material, in case a digital change of contrast and colors can highlight something useful. As I said, there was not a sound to be heard, so if they were airplanes they must have had fairly quiet engines or were very far away. A more realistic suggestion could be some form of hot air balloons (borne by the wind it could explain the very constant and uniform movement of all the objects), but we have not been able to find any description of this in the media this evening, and also have no suggestion of the rational in putting so many balloons into the air at the same time. Another realistic suggestion could be that the objects were satellites (space junk or similar) in orbit around the earth - an expert in astronomy must be able to analyse/tell about the movement, which, seen from our window, fits with objects in orbit that pass over the horizon.",

        "content": "I have evening and night work at the Business School, Århus (HHÅ). On my way home and out of the building I see through a window a bright star I have not seen before. I admire it a bit and then move on. Apparently no movement of the star. Five minutes later, my wife and I, who also cleans at HHÅ, leave the building. My wife gets into the car while I go to stamp out. I spot a clear, non-glaring, orb of light fly across the sky, and I realize it&#39;s the star from before. The ball of light is warm yellow, approaching orange. No sound is heard, and the ball of light does not flash like on an airplane, and it is precisely not a dot of light, but a ball of light. I look at it and then stamp out. On the way back to the car, I look for the ball of light again and probably catch a few glimpses of it. Immediately inside the car, I tell my wife that I have seen a flying saucer, which was not saucer-shaped but round. We drive out through the gate, and I see a ball of light disappear behind a roof ridge and immediately afterwards a ball of light emerges from the roof ridge further on, and I immediately know that they are two different balls of light. I no longer turn right, but left and onto a large parking lot between HHÅ and the former Musikkonversatorium (now also part of HHÅ). Here I see 5 balls of light flying across the sky. My wife thinks she counted 6 orbs to start with. They all look the same, all bright, clear, warm yellow balls of light. I stop the car and get out. No sound to be heard. The balls of light move at a steady speed across the sky and maintain the relative position. As I remember it, two relatively close to each other at the front, then a little way down to ball of light No. 3 and then a little way down to the two at the back, which have a greater distance between them than the two at the front. I take out my cell phone and try to take a picture, sure it won&#39;t turn out well due to lighting conditions and distance. (I have taken night pictures from the balcony at HHÅ before, when there have been fireworks on the harbour. The pictures are not very good). We look at the orbs of light that continue as a line, no lateral movement, no change of speed - it&#39;s like watching a star sign fly away. The balls of light disappear behind the trees along the east side of the parking lot. I look at the mobile phone clock: 00:41. We drive out onto Fuglesangs Alle and down and out onto Viborgvej and towards Hasle. Before we reach the first traffic light at Brugsen and OK-Benzin at Viborgvej, we see two more balls of light. They look exactly like the others, same size (well actually same height), same color, same course and speed. At the intersection, we see a car turn up, as if the driver is following the balls of light. A little further up Viborgvej we see a man standing on the pavement talking on a mobile phone - we are of course sure that he has seen the UFOs and is calling home with the news! Soon after, a police car comes driving at normal speed towards Aarhus - we don&#39;t know if they saw anything. At home I look at the photograph. I don&#39;t know if the lone ball of light in the photo is one of the light balls or just a light pole in the parking lot. I&#39;ll look for it tonight at work. Here later it occurs to me that the first &quot;star&quot; I saw may not be among the 5 balls of light we saw afterwards. It took approx. 5 minutes from when I saw the &quot;star&quot; until we walked out the door. Possibly the &quot;star&quot; has flown away and the other balls of light have come to the side, just like the last two.",

There were two small luminous dots that looked very much like the stars you see with the naked eye. No twinkle or colors - just like stars. The strange thing was that they lay side by side and followed each other very high in the sky in movements like a snake. They were higher than ordinary planes, were unusually fast and had no sound. The observation lasted approx. 9-12 seconds and then they were gone. Maybe physics can give us an explanation?",

They could see it when they drove from Borrevejle and towards Kr. Shelves. The cone of light remained in the sky for approx. 15 min., it took to drive from Lyndby to Kr. Shelves. They lived on a road in Kirke Hyllinge and could see the cone of light clearly until they got out of the car in front of their driveway on the road in Kr. Shelves. They stopped the car so that the person in the passenger seat could quickly get out and see what it was. As soon as the person was out, the light disappeared, and the only thing visible was a green light far out on one side and a red light far out on the other side just above the car. There was no sound at all. After that, no observations. Right after their observation, they called me in Valby, from where they had just driven, to report what they had seen.",

The light is double, i.e. it looks like 2 light bulbs next to each other. My immediate assessment is that the light is 500-1,000 meters in front of me, and the light is flashing approx. 1 time per second (on ½ second, off ½ second). As I approach Højrebyvej (route 291), the light continues in a northerly direction. The view of the light is briefly blocked by vegetation along the road, but I can follow it for a few minutes until it is so low above the horizon (about 5 degrees) that I suspect buildings or vegetation are blocking the view. At this point, I would think that the light is near Keldernæs/Blans in Nordlolland. Cloudless and starry, approx. 10 degrees heat. I was in a moving car so I didn&#39;t hear any engine or rotor noise. My first thought was that it was either a drone or a small passenger plane (ULF or similar).",

Approx. 200 meters before we reach an illuminated UNO X tank, the light suddenly goes out on the car, and at the same moment the light also disappears on the UNO X tank. It gets totally dark and my wife brakes violently, but after 10-20 seconds the light comes on again on the car, at the same time as the light also comes back on at the service station. We have no natural explanation for it, but there were 2 of us who experienced the same thing.",

Quite slowly, completely silently, the &quot;car&quot; moved from north to south approx. 200 m from us. On each side was a flashing red light. Both front and back, a series of lights in 2 maybe 3 different colors, yellow, white light yellow? At the back of the cabin (corresponding to the rear window/hat shelf area) of the &quot;flying car&quot; there was a dim light. I turned into the driveway. The object continued slowly over the trees in Vigerslevparken, to the south. We didn&#39;t wait to see more as the 2 of the passengers who were children and myself were a bit puzzled and confused about the silent possible helicopter?",

The time is approx. 16.00, and the weather is warm and a bit hazy - but no clouds, except on the horizon. I sit and watch the birds and a group of trees on the other side of the water (to the east), and suddenly see a bright flash of light just above the treetops. I look in the direction of the flash, and there is now a dimly lit spot on the spot that wasn&#39;t there before. It&#39;s quite far away, I want to shoot at 8-10 km away, and way up in the air layers. This luminous point, which has now come into view, begins to move slowly to the left, ie. in a northerly direction and I quickly find my camera from my bag to try to film it. However, the object is so far away that the zoom function is unable to capture it, so I give up and try to maintain eye contact instead. It disappears with the same steady speed behind the treetops, but appears on the other side. After approx. 20-30 sec. fades the object out and disappears. It cannot have been a &quot;flare&quot;, as it moved in a horizontal trajectory, was too far up, and traveled quite a distance, several kilometers at least. I can also rule out a satellite as they don&#39;t appear in a flash of light and fade out; however, the light traveled at the same high speed as a satellite before disappearing.

On Tuesday evening, 18/4, my girlfriend and I are sitting in our apartment on the 2nd floor on Sletterhagevej in Risskov. I&#39;m sitting with my phone and my boyfriend is watching TV (family fun anno 2023🙂 ). Suddenly, out of the corner of our eyes, we both see a green light/dot moving extremely fast (appearing southwest of our apartment). It appears out of nowhere and moves west and down, where it disappears behind the apartments opposite ours. However, it all takes place in a split second. Immediately, it was not a shooting star, as the distance does not seem quite out in the sky, as the size was much larger than that. It was, however, not immediately close either (it was immediately a short distance behind the apartment it disappeared behind). Pretty sure it wasn&#39;t a drone or fireworks. Visually, it looked like a ticking &quot;drag&quot; of a green tail, but this is probably more due to the speed (visually for the eyes). It was all without sound.",

I picked up some movement among the stars to the east, it looked like a star, but when I got to look properly, I could ascertain that it was definitely not a star (shooting star) and not a flyer either. It continued on a straight course and at times disappeared behind stars and reappeared until it disappeared just above the listed address. D therefore no compass direction as it was straight up (looked like it was moving away from the ground as it gradually got fainter and fainter in brightness) it traveled about a distance equal to a forearm, without the hand. I have previously observed something similar together with 2 others, it was mid-July 2013 at approx. 01.00. The position was then in Fuglebjerg, where it moved from south to north, with improbable speed (held up the forearm and from observation point &quot;elbow&quot; to end &quot;fingertip&quot;, it took about 5 min). At that time it stopped and appeared to be moving towards Earth as it grew brighter and larger (comparable to &quot;a small lamp&quot; becoming a much larger lamp) before finally standing still for about 2 min., after which it withdrew and followed the same route as it had come for approx. 20 sec. to finally change course, from due north to due east and disappear, just like the one I just saw. I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that what I/we have seen cannot have been naturally occurring events, as the track has changed each time, but today only away.... I tried to take pictures/film with phone, but unfortunately it cannot be seen due to poor lighting conditions.",

I almost always do that when I walk the dog when it&#39;s dark. Unfortunately I haven&#39;t got my glasses on, but I can still see pretty clearly, just not sharp. I first look towards the Moon, which is quite clear and almost directly above the house, almost at the same time I see what I think is a rather bright star almost directly below the Moon. I look further and then turn my gaze to the Moon again, here I discover that what I thought was a powerful star is moving with constant speed across the sky to the east. The speed does not match an airplane, nor can I see the normal lights that flash on an airplane. I now rush in for my glasses and out again, and I now clearly see that it looks like a star in appearance and an airplane in terms of position in the sky and the speed also corresponds to an airplane, but the flashing lights are missing, and at no time have I heard a sound as if it were an airplane. I also wonder if it could be a satellite, but it is too low in the sky to be, I think. I probably follow it with my eyes for 3-5 minutes before it disappears into the horizon. My conclusion is that I have no idea what it was I saw.",

        "content": "At approx. 16.30 on 23/04/2009 my son calls. He is standing out in his garden looking at a strange phenomenon through his binoculars. I quickly grab my own binoculars and rush outside. With a cell phone in one hand and binoculars in the other, I get instructions from my son on where to find the phenomenon. I can&#39;t see it with the naked eye and search with binoculars. The sky is blue and almost cloudless. After a few misunderstandings about east and west, I get a milky white object in the binoculars. Approx. at 8 and at 5 at a short distance from the milky white object, stand two slightly smaller objects shining metallic. The small objects do not stand still, but seem &quot;nervous&quot;. The small object, standing approx. at 8, makes a sudden movement towards the large object and back again. Almost like a jump. Back and forth in less than a second. A few seconds later, the two small objects disappear so quickly that I have no precise sense of direction. Maybe to the northwest. The large object remains standing. It is high in the sky to the north, about 70-80 degrees up. The sun is low to the left (west, southwest), and it fits with the object being illuminated by the sun. After observing the object for approx. 5 minutes without any movement or activity, we call it off, as it is a bit difficult with only one hand to hold the binoculars for that long. We agree that we will be called later. After a few more minutes, the object begins to move slowly to the south, i.e. even higher in the sky. I lay down on the lawn with the binoculars to keep it more stable. The movement is slow, and after a short pause it begins to move slightly to the south-southwest (toward the sun). Then the object turns sharply to the northwest (a turn of approx. 110-120 degrees). The speed is still slow, but it does not turn in an arc, but in a &quot;break&quot; without changing the speed. Suddenly the object is gone. I don&#39;t see the direction, it&#39;s just gone. After searching the area of the sky where it disappeared for approx. 5 min., I give up finding it again. Our son calls again. He has also lost sight of the object. If I were to judge the size of the object, I would compare it to when I see an airliner flying across the sky at a high altitude. I had approx. the same tremors in the binoculars due to the distance, so the sensation was that the object was the size of an airliner. I will also say that the object was quite clear in binoculars and there were no fins or anything protruding from the object. It was completely smooth. Once I knew exactly where it was in the sky, I could also see it with the naked eye. I sensed at first that it was a spherical object, but as I observed the object, it initially changed shape slightly. as if it occasionally became more elliptical in shape. I therefore began to sense that I was seeing a domed underside of an object that was not spherical. The observation took place in Horsens South and for me lasted approx. 15 minutes It gave an unusually strange sensation to see such an object in daylight. I am used to seeing many strange light phenomena at night, as I have two reflecting telescopes, one large and one small portable. I have also often seen many different planes at different heights and distances with my binoculars. It sure wasn&#39;t a plane, a balloon, a helicopter, or anything else I&#39;ve seen before. The two small objects I caught a glimpse of were also highly unusual. Especially their very sudden movements and completely different way of shining. As if they themselves shone or were completely shiny and made of metal, whereas the large object was milky white and illuminated by the sun.",

        "content": "It happened when I was a child, so the episode dates back quite a few years, so me and my parents cannot remember the exact year, date and month. But the incident itself is very clear. I was 8 or 9 years old. The year 1978 or 1979. It was winter with snow. We think it&#39;s January or February. Our neighbor boy and I had gone sledding on a hill near his home. I had my dog with me. A dachshund that I tied to a pole where we were sledding. The landscape here is very hilly. A large hill divided by a small road. We sledded down the small hill so we wouldn&#39;t have to sled out onto the road. It is getting dark when the dog gives in to beeping and pulling on the leash in fright. Of course we become aware of it and wonder why it behaves like that. The boy next door says so. Look there - and points up the hill on the other side of the road. There is a large round luminous spot/circle, approx. 6-8 mi diameter, on the snow. It was like seeing a cone from a huge flashlight. The only difference was that the light didn&#39;t come from anywhere. There was no beam of light from anywhere. There was no sound either, but it surprises me that the dog reacted so strongly, maybe it could hear or feel something that we didn&#39;t pick up. How the circle of light got there we did not see, but it just disappeared on the spot. So we didn&#39;t see anything flying or gliding away. It disappeared as suddenly as when you press a light switch. It was there for 3-4 minutes at the most. Certainly less, but it felt long. I was now as scared as my dog and quickly ran home. So did the neighbor boy. When I got home, I was completely out of it, shaking and crying, didn&#39;t show what this was, and both my parents could both see and feel that I had been through something. that had scared me. I explained it to my parents as soon as they calmed me down a bit. They wanted to go there at once to see if there were any traces of anything, perhaps in the snow. I was terrified. Didn&#39;t want to be home alone, but certainly not with that again either. However, the end of it was that we went there again. Maybe half an hour to a full hour later. There was no trace of either people or anything else in the snow. The snow hadn&#39;t melted either. For the rest of my childhood I was afraid to cycle past this place when it was dark, so it made a big impression to see something inexplicable. I don&#39;t know what it was, but since the light came from nowhere, I&#39;ve had a hard time figuring out what it was. It can&#39;t have been cars, as they can&#39;t possibly shine up there, and the lights have a beam of light. Here last year I met again with the boy next door and I said... do you remember then..., yes he could. And my parents also remember when I came home and was scared.",

There is no sound and it gets weird as we can&#39;t see any other lights like on an airplane. At the same time, the light begins to fade (the object now has a position of 0 degrees N) and you can sense a dark object. The light disappears completely, and it&#39;s like the object is now falling down, and I grab a pair of binoculars and can now see a dark object of a rectangular shape, falling from the sky like a piece of cardboard would - that is, relatively slowly and in an odd trajectory. The object hits the water and I watch it for maybe a few minutes as it lies on the water, but when I look again - after maybe 5 minutes - it&#39;s gone.",

The lights are coming closer and closer to me - I can&#39;t hear anything. The lights come so close that I per reflex makes fuck finger (thought at first - a drone with photo), but again the two red lights are too far apart for that and no sound at all. When I do f... finger the lights stay still and reverse the direction and continue towards the water and towards Aarhus. When the lights change direction, 3 white lights appear next to each of the 2 red lights, and I get up and follow the lights until I can no longer see them.

        "content": "It has been many years today since I saw the unidentifiable object. We have to go all the way back to the mid-80s (somewhere between 1984 and 86), but it&#39;s still an experience I remember very clearly and one I&#39;ve never really put down. It was late in the evening and I it had become quite dark. At the time I must have been about 9-10 years old, I think, and I was that evening with my little brother and big brother and my big brother&#39;s friend down at our playground. At the time, we lived in a terraced house in Greve. The playground was relatively small and consisted of two wooden houses and a large sandpit as well as three asphalt hills of different sizes. The playground was surrounded by bushes and hedges, and around the hedges the terraced houses were close to the playground. From the hedge to the nearest terraced house was probably around 4-5 metres. I remember we were standing on the biggest hill when the incident happened, but I also think that some of us were standing below the hill, and there may have been other children present as well. In front of us, above one of the terraced houses that surrounded the playground, and it cannot have been more than 10-15 meters from us, a very large white and powerful light suddenly appeared. I remember we all looked at it for a while, how long I have a hard time remembering though. The light immediately seemed to float right above the terraced house in front of us (we were now standing on the big asphalt hill looking at it) and at some point we all choose to run around the house to, I think, see if there is anything at the back of the house or the light. Suddenly, however, the light is gone as suddenly as it came. It was such a violent experience that we all rushed home to our parents, probably shouting at each other that we had seen a UFO. Since that day, I have tried to rationally analyze the incident. After all, I wasn&#39;t that old at the time, so many things could have enhanced the experience. However, what still puzzles me to this day was that I don&#39;t remember the object/light making any kind of sound or for that matter smell, because I/we would have noticed. I also don&#39;t remember that we saw it coming, but that it just happened. It could therefore not have been a parachute rocket, because we would have both seen and heard that, and the light was simply too big to be a parachute rocket. It can&#39;t have been a cone of light either, as we were simply too close to not detect if it was, and the townhouses have completely flat roofs and there were no people or light fixtures on the roof. The light was not high in the sky either, but was only 10-15 meters in front of us and almost at eye level, since we were standing on the highest hill. I don&#39;t remember the light as having an oblong shape, but more oval and quite large, maybe more than 2 meters in width and height. We all knew what a rocket looked like and, not least, sounded like, and the funny thing was that I just don&#39;t remember the light making any sound, it seemed to suddenly just appear out of nowhere. Luckily it couldn&#39;t have been a ball lightning as it was simply too big for this and as I said was silent. I can&#39;t imagine that ball lightning is silent, and there was no storm forecast that night. The light was round, silent and very bright, but after all not so bright that we had to shield our eyes. The light disappeared silently, as suddenly as it appeared. I don&#39;t remember my eyes being on the object when it disappeared, because it disappeared while we were running around the other side of the townhouse. Nevertheless, we were quite a few witnesses (at least 4) who all saw and experienced the same thing, and I still cannot explain what it was that we saw that day many years ago. To me anyway, the incident remains mysterious and inexplicable to this day.",

Regards. size, it looks a lot like Venus, which I also thought it was right when I saw it. But suddenly it starts to fade and become very small and then it disappears like something you only see in movies. Just as if it accelerates very violently and disappears upwards in an easterly direction into nothing. It was unlike any shooting star I&#39;ve seen before. Unfortunately, I saw it on April 1st, so my family just kind of laughs at the whole thing and of course thinks it&#39;s a joke. However, I would like to emphasize that it is not. Of course, I hope that others have seen the same thing as me and may have seen it a little before I saw it. I almost just saw it disappear. But it was a very surreal experience for me and something I won&#39;t soon forget.",

        "content": "Here we go again. I have written the observation from Egå on 1 July 2012. This time it is on the beach 3 km north of Blokhus. I take a dusk walk down to the water and a few km along the beach. A light, like a flash, comes at regular intervals from the horizon to the west, and in the clear night I can see a distant top of a thundercloud, which I can subsequently see on DMI&#39;s lightning radar driving approx. 100 km off the coast. While waiting for the next flash of lightning, I look up at the Chariot and a little to the left of it, almost vertically, I observe an object that flashes 2-3 times followed by a pause where it cannot be seen, and ½ minute later it flashes again and has now moved from 85 degrees to perhaps 70 degrees to the west and again after approx. Half a minute later it is seen again via the 2-3 flashes around 60 degrees to the west. Here it is as if it &quot;stabilises&quot;. Fine. Probably just an observation plane, with some unstable blinkers. But no. In the next ten minutes, it happens that every time the object has flashed 2-3 times, 4-5 objects light up, which shine like some of the faintest stars and move lightning fast criss-crossing each other north of the flashing object. When they stop after 3 seconds, they turn off again and then turn on again after 2-3 flashes from the other object, and they again move quickly between each other. I would think this is happening many hundreds of kilometers away. I now go home to the cottage without looking up again. At the summer house, the urge and security to look up again is present, but the phenomenon is gone. On the other hand, there will now be another object at approx. 01.45 from due west at steady speed to the east, and this object cannot be seen as a satellite shining constantly. It is only seen when it flashes once at irregular intervals of between 3 and 10 seconds. The flash is very strong, like a powerful searchlight very far up (no engine sound during both observations). Hope you can explain the observation at 01.45 with something man-made, otherwise it will soon become too burdensome to look up at the night sky. On the way home from the beach after the first sighting, I philosophized about whether it is me who has watched too many UFO videos on Youtube and is going crazy, or whether there is perhaps something brewing from outer space. But why should they come right now, while I&#39;m alive and not 500 million years ago or maybe only in 100,000 years? Well, maybe just now, because within the last few hundred years we have really made our existence known via eternal light from the cities on the dark side of the earth, which can probably be seen with &quot;their&quot; equipment far away. We also show that we have a form of intelligence with our wireless communication and satellites, which can probably also pick up signals from far away.",

I look to the right across the lake towards the buildings along the lake on the Nørrebro side. I see a sharp flash low in the sky above the ridges of the roofs. But have to get off the bike to take a closer look, as I can quickly see that it is not an airplane. The light coming from it is in a rotating motion under the aircraft and every time the light appears in my direction I can sense a flat and elongated shape. At first it is completely still. Then it moves slowly to the east, in a very straight line. It then changes direction very rapidly to the west, where it stands still again, and then flies in a still direction still to the west. I cycle quietly towards Søpavillionen in the same direction and keep an eye on the aircraft. When I turn right onto HC Andersens Boulevard, the aircraft disappears behind the roof of the Lake Pavilion, and when I pass the Lake Pavilion, the aircraft is gone. It was difficult for me to sense the size and distance. But had the feeling that it was quite large, but flew quite low. If you guys have a good explanation for what I saw, I&#39;m very interested in hearing it!",

        "content": "Tonight, at 21.48, I made an observation. At first I saw two &quot;approach landing lights&quot;, however I was surprised that they were yellow/orange. I went to check Flightradar24.com but there was nothing to see. When I returned there were another 6 heading E (088) with two of them flying NE (055-075). My first guess as to what it could be was that it might be a bunch of students in T-17, but it didn&#39;t fit if they had their landing lights on that it should be yellow/orange. In addition, the speed did not fit, as I estimate it to be between 250-300 knots (I am comparing here with the daily approaches of B737, A320 etc. to EKBI). As for the altitude, I estimate it to be between 4500 and 3000 ft. I took a picture with my mob., but it turned out bad, but I also took some film of it, and there might be something on it. I followed the two flying NE with binoculars and managed to see the flying objects in silhouette, and it could easily resemble an aviator, but certainly not an airliner, it was too small for that. It could be an F-16, I&#39;m thinking in that order of magnitude, but what surprised me the most was that there was no sound!? There were also no anti-collision lights, beacons, strobes or navigation lights. In closing, I just want to mention that I don&#39;t believe in little green men. I&#39;m a big aviation geek and study astronomy, astrophysics and theoretical quantum physics. I have reasonable control over various satellites such as Envisat, Iridium and ISS. But I am now quite convinced that it was something man-made, approx. 1000 m above ground. With the hope that you can, and will, save the thread for me, I want to say a thousand thanks in advance.",

I have made a habit of going for an evening walk, especially on starry nights like tonight. I was looking at the Chariot (Big Bear) and Cassiopeia when I heard a &quot;passenger plane&quot; idling, sounds you often hear in Amager! I can&#39;t say for sure that it was a non-terrestrial object, but it looked mysterious, along with the apparent airliner noise. The objects were moving in a southerly direction and were bright orange, or amber if you will. There were three of them flying in a triangle formation, each of the objects consisting of three orange lights in a row. Above IslandsBrygge Metrostation they split, two of them took a more westerly course and the third banked east. I am a bit surprised by the sight, as I believe that aviation regulations dictate that all aircraft must carry two white flashing lights on the wings, and a red one on the back, as well as an orange one under the fuselage. It is not unusual to see planes at Amager, not even in the evening, but I cannot explain this in any way. I hope Ii can shed some light on the matter, and what it actually was I saw! Because I thought I saw :)",

She comes and sees the strange light which is now spinning around to the south (at that time I have opened the window to the east where I saw the light) No sound like a machine or helicopter, completely quiet. The light now becomes weaker and rises in a circle from south to east and further to the north. Now I get my photo rapport, but now it&#39;s over. The light was like a dot and fainter at the end as we saw it. We have many airplanes and occasionally helicopters during the day and evening, but they fly with flashing lights and further away, not with constant lights. We have lived on the 7th floor in Hjallese for 5 years and have never seen anything similar, I have always kept an eye on that. It wasn&#39;t cloudy. Distance is difficult, maybe 500 m from. Sound would be audible with the window open.",

As it sort of changed direction, the light sort of silently slipped off of it.. I think it was the sun shining at the bottom, it was very similar both in the way the light disappeared on and on, the play of colors of the light when it was there.. When the light disappeared, you could suddenly see that it was completely black and absolutely nothing light was on... I was inside looking for my camera, but couldn&#39;t find it.. And when I came out, I could see it disappear quietly into some dark clouds... It generally flew very calmly, softly and slowly and did not immediately look oblong like a normal plane, more high and compact in that... My father, who is VERY skeptical in this field (am I myself), he says, would have a hard time saying what it was, but that he would guess a helicopter... But that at the same time he thought it was very strange that he couldn&#39;t hear it, since it didn&#39;t seem like it was that far away, and that it looked very strange, and had a very strange flight path to the north..",

After approx. 60 seconds of observing the light in the glow of the city lights. Had it been dark, it would have been visible for a longer time. The given position is measured from Google Earth. The beginning and end bearings are measured via Google Earth together with bearings for trees and houses in the area. Don&#39;t think this could have been a satellite as the speed was greatly reduced as the light got weaker. Considers it likely that it was a plane with afterburners that made a course change at the end of the observation. The time indication is accurate within +/- 1 minute, as the observation was concluded with a look at the mobile phone clock.",

Could hardly bear to be looked at at first with that general. eye, but the light was somewhat dimmed, and then shone down and spread out to both sides. The light also changed colors a few times, from dim red to strong red and was continuous for a few minutes at a time, before changing back to bright light. All of a sudden there were approx. 10 small slightly oval objects in the sky, they moved very quickly and like in jerks, the small ones were completely dark, but since it was a summer night they could be clearly seen. The big round with the light was completely silent in the sky. Suddenly the small ones were gone and only the big one remained and just as suddenly it and all the light was gone too. I had woken up my partner at the time, because this was too good and at the same time too strange to experience alone - so we were two adults who stood and watched this inexplicable thing.",

Not usually something I do in, but it was hot in the house, and cooler outside. It&#39;s not quite dark yet for me to think I can see shooting stars, so after some time on my back on the sofa I&#39;m considering going inside. But to the left, out on the horizon, a white/yellow &quot;ball&quot; appears. It&#39;s not big and seems like it&#39;s far away. It rises from the horizon into the sky. Faster than a drone, Chinese lamp, or anything else I&#39;ve thought of it could be. I follow it with my eyes, and after a while it seems as if it is as high up as the stars. Equally faint and small, yet luminous. I think I&#39;m going crazy and look at all the other stars that twinkle but are completely still. This one moves in circles. Not a specific pattern, but just randomly around. I think it is affected by the weather so high up, but it does not disappear. I don&#39;t believe in goblins or aliens, but I have to ask my girlfriend if she can come out to look, but she&#39;s breastfeeding and has to cuddle the baby. I try to take a video but it&#39;s so far away that my mobile can&#39;t capture it. I keep looking and call my brother. He lives 10 km away and wonders if he can see it. It&#39;s just too hard for me to explain where it is in the sky, and since it doesn&#39;t move very much, and is so small, we give up. It does not move over the horizon, but just dances around now and then, and far, far away. I go in after a little while, and today I have to write about my report, as I am very interested in hearing if others have discovered something similar in the sky.",

Next I notice that it is not flying slowly and lazily like an airplane approaching for landing. It looks like it&#39;s bouncing up and down a bit every now and then. But it could be an optical illusion. I realize it&#39;s a UFO and run in for my cell phone. I&#39;m trying to take a picture, but since I&#39;m not wearing reading glasses, I can&#39;t see if it&#39;ll come to anything. Then I set my iPhone to video and try to film the glowing circle as it flies towards Sweden. It doesn&#39;t make a sound and it flies relatively fast. Eventually it disappears into the horizon. It all takes 2-3 minutes. I have not been able to confirm whether anyone else saw the flying object - and whether it could be a drone.

        "content": "I observed an orange light, which I initially thought was the light of a distress signal. However, it was less sharp in intensity than an emergency flare, and the height above the horizon could not really match an emergency signal either. After a few seconds the light began to rise upwards and to the left, and soon after it was 2 lights with a fairly constant distance moving. The movement was not constant, but interrupted by small pauses, and sometimes the movement even went slightly backwards, almost in small jerks. After approx. 30 seconds later the light disappears, but is replaced almost immediately afterwards by another 2 lights, which behave exactly like the first 2, but with the difference that before the 2 disappear they are supplemented by another 1 light, which also follows the other 2 out to the left , but with a greater distance. After a few minutes, another light appears, exactly where the others started. This light remains alone and behaves like the others. In total, I thus saw 6 points of light disappear. During the process, what my experience tells me, an airplane comes over the horizon, from west to east, with flashing lights, and it may well be that the pilot or the passengers may have seen the lights that I saw. I can best describe the starting point on the horizon with the help of the Chariot. If you take the opposite end of the &quot;handle&quot; of the Chariot, there are 2 stars that draw an almost vertical line. If you continue this line towards the ground, it is close to the place where the lights showed their appearance, although starting a little way up in the sky.",

        "content": "Friday evening I grab my binoculars to admire the unusually large &quot;Jupiter&quot; I saw toward the SSV. It was NOT Jupiter, and it was under a light cloud cover with almost blinding white light, like laser led lights. After looking at it a bit, I called my neighbor&#39;s wife, who didn&#39;t pick it up, but called back, and I asked her to go outside and see if she could also see the UFO hanging out there to the south. She could, and as she immediately said, we are not alone, but what is he doing up there. We probably looked at it for five to ten minutes. It floated a little higher above us, and she could see it flashing red (I couldn&#39;t, I have rather poor night vision, where the red light of the windmills often disappears for me), it also seemed to split in two. We saw a plane go high above it from approx. Hanstholm towards Aalborg, and clearly heard the aircraft engine. No sound from the UFO. Occasionally it would fade out for a second, then reappear. Then it disappeared a little behind the clouds, which lay on the horizon, but then it shone behind the clouds, just as when the Moon can light up behind the clouds. Although the small light was only one-fifth to one-tenth of the new moon&#39;s sigil, it lit up like a full moon behind the clouds. And then it came out again. A single mini dot of light stood out and disappeared towards Løgstør/Livø. We froze miserably, so Solveig went in and finished tucking the children, and I put on a flight suit and tried to photograph it with my late husband&#39;s Iphone 13 S. It took 3 seconds. , and I kept it on a birdhouse, but it just turned out to be a white blob. Then it disappeared - faded away again. It turned out that the neighbor&#39;s wife took her 12-year-old boy out, and he saw it too. Before it completely faded away I managed to call my neighbor on the other side and got her to go out and watch it, I&#39;m not entirely sure if her boyfriend got to see it. At eleven I just had to go for the last walk with the dog, and then it hung out there again. Now, however, all the houses were switched off, and I didn&#39;t call anyone, but went a little down the road, and up a country road, and now it wasn&#39;t heading south, but heading north, it disappeared - and a mini light streaked north. Saturday morning when I got up at 6.25 it hung outside again - approx. those 30 - 45 degrees above the horizon, and in binoculars I could clearly see the red flash, it appeared as if it was turning clockwise, and the red came out, but also white all the time. I texted the neighbor&#39;s husband when I knew he was up there milking. Then I turned and made coffee and oatmeal and when I came back it was gone and my text hadn&#39;t been sent. It must be said that I have been thrown by my WIFI many times since 3-10. Well, a little talk back and forth gave that the hunter who has the hunt does not use drones to hunt marten. Training of Ukrainians takes place in England, and ends on 11-11. So there was an international militia meeting in Aalborg last week... could they have played with drones over a field in Vust, 9690 Fjerritslev? Saturday night very cloudy, and then nothing. Sunday morning (today) I got up at 6.25, looked out and up: AND the whole sky was lit up by, I said 30, but there were maybe only 20 bright UFOs, the closest ones flashing clearly (without binoculars) with red. The neighbor&#39;s husband called at five past seven and asked where she was - I asked if he had NOW seen them - no he had just seen a lot of stars. By then it had started to lighten and there were probably only two distinct ones left. I think his eyes, coming straight from inside the strong neon light in the milking shed, had a hard time seeing them? I don&#39;t know if he saw them. I had also called the hunter I spoke to the day before, but he is in Zealand and working until Tuesday. I guess that&#39;s all I can tell you now and here. But at least I get up early tomorrow!!",

I chose to look at the lights while they were there, and when apparently no more came, I hurried down into the living room to possibly follow them from there, but then there was nothing to see. This is my observation - whether there have been more lights before &quot;my&quot; lights, I can&#39;t say anything about.",

        "content": "For approx. 17 – 18 years ago (1983-84? - 1983 is most likely!) I experienced my first (and so far only) UFO. It was a cold and clear morning, the 13th of November, an hour before it got light. I was out driving with newspapers in Kgs. Lyngby and was on my way over the motorway bridge (Klampenborgvej!) when on the horizon, over Copenhagen, I saw a bright red light hanging completely still in the air. It was somewhat larger than a star and with a clarity like a taillight on a car. It hung approx. three finger widths above the city. There was no flicker and it just hung there, completely still, there was simply not a sound to be heard. I stopped my bike and stood there for approx. 5 minutes (I enjoyed the silence and the pause in the newspaper distribution). I wondered if it was Mars, but the position didn&#39;t match, so I was a bit confused. (I am an amateur astronomer and at the time in question was associated with KAF (Copenhagen Astronomical Association). Suddenly the light began to move very slowly, obliquely up to the left from my position, which has been east until it reached a position above Gentofte, where it , without stopping, changed direction at a sharp angle and flew in a straight line to a point above Jægersborg, where it changed direction to the east again. All the while it simultaneously moved north towards my position. The light changed direction 6 times in total and had finally reaching a position almost over my head. It had grown surprisingly little in comparison to the fact that it seemed to be coming towards me, just high up in the air. When it reached the final point over Jægersborg, it flew in a big arc back again towards Copenhagen where it disappeared on the horizon. The whole affair must have taken a maximum of 10 minutes in total. I contacted SUFOI the same evening (a local watchman I think) where I was told that I had observed a helicopter (!!!). Nothing with maybe, but a helicopter, like that! The person was, to put it mildly, very rude, as if he just wanted to get rid of me in a hurry, and I remember thinking that he might as well just rush me to a certain place and hung up. I later regretted not going further with my observation, but I will make up for that here.",

I therefore took my usual route down through the city, where I enjoyed the view of the sky and the beauty of the city out towards the fjord. On the way I stop at the theater, I have to grab my lighter. I light my smoke when I spot what I assumed was the light of an airplane heading for the airport. It dawns on me shortly after that the light doesn&#39;t blink, it stays on as opposed to bright and moves quite slowly. At first I thought it was a satellite, but quickly changed my mind when I noticed the speed increased tremendously. At that time, the light is on its way behind some buildings between Budolfi Plads and Bleggårdsgangen. I therefore wandered over to Bleggårdsgangen, where the view out to the direction in which the light moved was sufficiently open for me to observe further. However, the light had disappeared when I got there. The light was strong, but not because it was shining down on me. The light was solid, i.e. not see through, seemed like a white pearl floating in the water. The light was bigger than a star, it was thick, like a ball or pearl. I didn&#39;t think the light was very high in the sky, judging by the thickness of the light that made it seem like it was close.",

It was high up, faster than a normal plane. It quickly disappeared into the horizon. This repeated three times, a new ball appearing at regular intervals and flying in the same direction. After this I turned around and went the opposite way, after which the process repeated itself twice more, what I observed. This time, however, it flew in a slightly different direction ... I met three other people who at that time had stopped in the street and stood observing the sky. We talked about what it could be but had no possible solutions. After that I went home and chose not to look up at the sky any more!",

Halfway to the lake I look behind and see this bright orange glowing object coming flying under the cloud cover. It was quite large, and had no sound, but was (apparently) pentagonal, so don&#39;t think it was a balloon. It flew swiftly across the sky and disappeared into a cloud. It just as quickly reappeared and disappeared. The evening has been extremely quiet at ground level, and the clouds have not moved at anything like the speed the object was traveling at. I tried to film it with my iphone, but the quality is just too poor... it&#39;s just a bright dot. Why didn&#39;t I just bring my DSLR in the first place?!? There is probably a reasonable explanation for that, but I think now that it seemed strange.",

        "content": "I stood looking out my kitchen window and saw what I first thought was a plane. It was much higher up than usual though, and didn&#39;t seem to have any actual length? It was very bright/white and shiny. I followed the object until it disappeared over the roof. I knew it would come up again on the living room side right after, so I grabbed my Nikon D600 ff camera, with a Sigma 50mm f 1.4 lens attached. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any zoom, but only fixed optics. When the object appeared on the living room side, the object has split into several similar objects. I counted 7 when I was photographing, but can see from the pictures that there were up to 12 pieces. It must be said that I have observed unexplained things in the sky before, but never anything that comes close to this! The objects followed a path where I could see that they were flying higher and higher, towards space. Pure guess, must be 20-30 km up? One thing that struck me was that the objects changed shape? or rotated synchronously so that you could see the shape of these. That is, that all objects looked alike at all times. I know it sounds like pure science fiction, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, in my world, it is conclusive proof that &quot;UFOs&quot; exist!! I have all the images in raw RAW, but have also converted them to jpg. for the sake of convenience. If you are interested in these, can I forward them? I can&#39;t really see where they can be attached? I managed to take 18 photos of the sighting and remembered to drive with a high aperture for the depth of field. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get to check the speed in the rush, so some of the pictures have motion blur. Others, however, are very fine, and you can sense shape etc. Fortunately, in some of the pictures there is a little house on one side, and a couple of clouds in the foreground, so you can sense some aspect ratio. I hope to God that there are others who have seen my observation, so I don&#39;t come across as completely crazy.. Compass direction etc. is found with the help of my IPad, where I use the program Skyview. Whether these are the correct &quot;compass directions&quot; I have written, I have no idea, but otherwise I can easily point out a direction, etc.",

The view is occasionally disturbed when the bus drives past trees along the road, but when there are openings the object is seen in the same position and motionless. This takes place through approx. 10 minutes until the bus turns off from the ring road. At first I think it could be a balloon, like those that are sometimes used for advertising; but there are no colors or logos etc. on it.

There are 3 of us standing in my yard and talking over a beer. It is dark and the sky is starry clear except for a single cloud formation consisting of 2 cigar-shaped clouds, very sharply defined. The clouds were spaced apart, one half above the other. In the upper cloud there was a round light, strongest in the middle, but transparent. As the clouds slowly move east I notice that the light follows, precisely positioned and fixed in the upper cloud. I point out the cloud to my two mates, who at first don&#39;t give it a real chance. Suddenly the light begins to move within the cloud, and you can clearly see that the light is moving on the cloud on the side of the light it is moving towards. I eagerly pointed it out for my friends to see, and just as they turn around, it takes off, leaving a black streak in a black sky. It goes so fast that you can&#39;t possibly follow it with your eyes. But out of the cloud this craft left a &quot;puff&quot; of cloud. We all saw this happen, and with 100% certainty it wasn&#39;t a cone of light, an airplane, a weather balloon, or anything like that. I&#39;m absolutely certain it was intelligent life. Barely 2 weeks later on New Year&#39;s Eve around At 18 we had to demonstrate some fireworks for my two boys, and again I, my brother and my nephew see the same spot of light in the clouds. As if a transparent vessel is on top of the clouds, or rather hiding behind them. I fetch my neighbor, who I have told and my experience from the yard and get him out into the street and see the phenomenon, - he thinks it is a cone of light from something on the ground, but it is cloudy and foggy that day and no cone to see, only the round spot which in this case stands firmly fixed in the sky. When we look up again it is gone, but 20 seconds. afterwards it appears again a little further out on the horizon over the Little Belt, between the coastline at Fredericia and the Little Belt Bridge. This time I see it &quot;lying&quot; above the clouds and going from indistinct light to clear and distinct. It then hangs there for the next few minutes and then suddenly disappears again. These experiences were quite mind-numbing, because I am neither crazy nor schizophrenic or anything. etc., and I can say with absolute certainty that these were vessels that are somehow able to appear only as light, transparent light.",

We were walking through our yard and I was walking with my head down towards the grass.... the yard is a little dark... and the sky is completely starry.... well but I looked down and in one of my glasses... I saw a very very bright almost flashing light... I looked up to the sky and saw the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life. I believe in life in space... meen has never seen more than millions of shooting stars.... as well as satellites.... I have no doubt.... something flew over me... and it was not a shooting star... not even a satellite... a thick thick jet of almost fire flew across the sky... at an insane speed... and then ended with an almost... poof... but in the puff... was a sharp.... green light... and it was gone.... my friend didn&#39;t get to see it at all...!!! I&#39;m in seven minds... really wish she had seen it too.... but it was really fast.... oops oops then sat the rest of the night looking up at the beautiful starry sky hoping that just a little glimpse again...",

I look out the window and see 3 very bright &quot;stars&quot;. I think it must be a plane, I get up and go to the window to take a closer look at the &quot;stars&quot;. At the same time, one of the stars first moves at great speed, then changes direction at an angle of approx. 120 degrees. I was scared, well aware that this is not normal. The other 2 &quot;stars&quot; also suddenly flew at angles very fast. I went to my desk and wrote, date, time and drew what I had seen on a piece of paper. I ran into my neighbor in the dorm to make her see and understand what I had experienced. Unfortunately, there was nothing to see in the sky from her window. I have thought a lot about this experience in all the years, aging, neither before nor since seen anything like it.",

I live in an apartment, and can only look up at the sky from my backyard. While I stand looking at the Chariot, an orange round ball suddenly floats very slowly across the sky. It is so close that I can see that it really glows. It stays on for approx. 20 seconds, when it flies straight up into the atmosphere with an indescribable speed, And out of nowhere it stops and stands almost still in the air. A short second later, it sets off at high speed across the sky again. No tail, just a bright orange light like it&#39;s been showing all along. At the beginning of the year, when I was out for an evening walk with my husband and daughter, I observed something that was almost similar. Then we lived in a small village 25 km outside Aalborg. There was snow and quite a beautiful starry sky. When we reach a green area where there are chalk hills and fields, we suddenly see an orange ball hovering about 6-10 km above our heads. It had no tail, it was not a plane, a hot air balloon or a Chinese launched balloon. Only a large orange ball that flew at a very slow speed. This observation lasted for almost 6 minutes. In a split second, this object also flew up into the atmosphere at an unimaginable speed, stood still at a certain point, and disappeared at high speed in a direction to the southeast.",

At 23.30 we see an object coming floating at a good speed across the sky, it was definitely not a shooting star or a satellite, there was no light on it and no tail, it was just a gray spot that flew over us from the north-east. It turned and flew in another direction to the south and then turned again and flew in a third direction to the northwest where it disappeared out of sight... We thought it was quite mysterious and talked about what it could be. We agreed that it couldn&#39;t be a bird either, as it was higher up than the clouds.. A quarter of an hour passed, then it came again from the west, and finally it flew over us, turned off to the south and disappeared behind the roof. Since it had no lights on, we could only see it because it was gray against the night sky, which was black. The way it turned, an airplane wouldn&#39;t be able to, it was quite sharp in its turns... And again, it had NO lights on... Have you heard of others who have seen the same phenomenon in the night sky in Helsingør in night? Guess we weren&#39;t the only ones out to watch the meteor shower.",

Somewhere in the sky a light starts in the southeast &quot;out of the blue&quot; and &quot;flies&quot; southwest for a certain distance and then disappears. But the funny thing is that the same light in color and strength then after a little moment reappears - exactly in the same place where it started. Then the light &quot;flies&quot; the same path or path across the sky as it had done before, and disappears in the same place again. This continues at least 10 times. Maybe 20. None of us could understand what was happening, what it was. Was it a drone? A satellite? It looked like a star or satellite in brightness and was probably not a searchlight from a lighthouse or something like that. We have not found out what it is, and we cannot rationally find an explanation for the phenomenon we all clearly experienced and were all puzzled about. Wondering what it was?",

        "content": "It was right around the August 1999 solar eclipse, either a few days before or after. I was 13 years old and alone at home that afternoon. It was partly cloudy. I stood on the balcony and looked, as I used to do once in a while, and then caught sight of it. It was completely chrome. Like a coin, I could see the sunlight reflected in it. I would estimate it to have been approx. 2-400 meters up. It &quot;hung&quot; slightly askew in the air, towards the left, and floated completely still. I stood and looked at it for about 10-15 minutes without anything happening. Then I went down to the laundry cellar and put a machine on, and when I came back up approx. 10 minutes later it was gone. Unfortunately, since there were no cameras in mobile phones then, I unfortunately never got to take a picture. The shape is hard to describe, but it most resembled a bowler hat. but more streamlined. And then without a hole in the bottom. I don&#39;t want to gamble too much on the size, but the size of a couple of cars is probably not an understatement.",

        "content": "Sunday 26 July 2015 around 22.55 I see something strange. I am standing in my kitchen on the second floor - the light is off - the window is open - and I can hear the usual traffic noise from Hovedvejen/Roskildevej. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I see a strange light coming from the south – down around Brøndby Stadium – in a northerly direction. It looks somewhat like &quot;gaslight&quot; in that it flickers between blue and green. It moves horizontally across the sky – it neither loses nor gains altitude – and then it is completely silent. As it passes my window I can see it has an oval shape. You have to make an effort to spot it, it is surrounded by some white dots. It is probably 50-100 meters above the ridge of the neighboring property - which is also a 2-storey dwelling. It seems to follow a route up along Vestvolden/Motorring 3. After passing my window, but before it seems to reach Jyllingevej, the light disappears abruptly - and it becomes invisible. The episode lasts 5-10 seconds. Then I look out of the window to the south and immediately spot a plane taking off from Kastrup and heading south. The wing lights of an airliner are clearly visible over a distance of more than 15 km. The &quot;gas light&quot; I had just witnessed was subdued - it did not sting the eyes in any way. Could the white spots I saw encircling the oval object be some sort of heat shield? It is difficult to say anything about the size – it could be anything from 6-12 meters long and 2-3 meters high.",

I had been looking to the north, turned to see if shooting stars would appear from the south. I am completely speechless, because in the south-eastern sky hangs a luminous yellow ball, approx. 8 mm measured with fingers. As I stand healing myself, noting that there are stars in the sky around it, another small ball comes sliding from the same direction, growing to the same size as the first. The object is positioned below the first object. There is some distance between the objects. The second ball sort of gave a little, as if adjusting its position before finding its location under the first object. Seeing these two objects standing in the sky approx. 4 seconds, after which the first disappears back into the sky. I see the sphere shrink - from a large sphere to a tiny dot, impossibly fast. The second ball disappears in the same way and just as quickly soon after. The whole session probably lasted 12-18 seconds.",

It stood still for approximately 20-30 seconds, after which it continued in a westerly direction, out along the headland, in the direction of the lighthouse. There were no sounds associated with the sighting, but when it suddenly picked up speed, from the area a little outside the garden where it was hovering, there was a hissing sound, from the object. Of details can be mentioned, it was shaped like two joined plates, or very flat bowls, the upper part was bright red, almost like flames, the lower part was bright blue, pulsating, and in the assembly of the discs, it shone pink/white, all the way around. On top it had what looked like a blue antenna that stuck up a bit. On one side, a window could clearly be seen, with light in it. On the underside, 3-4 dome-shaped objects could be seen, which stuck out a little in relation to the rest of the vessel. Combined with the stars behind, and other various lights, from airplanes etc. was this something completely unique that the son saw in the sky.",

Have spotted a very sharp star that is roughly straight ahead of my line of sight (almost due east), which I can spot just above the treetops (15-20 degrees?). The road goes almost straight the whole time, but at one point there is a small soft bend to the left and back to the right. Then, all of a sudden, the star appears to be moving, and the light begins to resemble the landing lights of a long-distance plane. So I&#39;m coming to believe that it must be a plane that is on its way to land in Karup instead. Coming closer and actually now expecting that I can see the plane close up, and see tail rudder etc., but am very surprised, as I think the object is very still in the air - almost floating like that. I drive past the object on my right, and I want to shoot for it to be 300-500 meters away. As I remember it, it had 4 red lights - almost in a square square, and then it also had other white lights in several places around. I just want to point out that I am color blind. My first idea for an explanation could be something with a mast I haven&#39;t seen before? Or a helicopter?",

They crossed each other and then disappeared in a northerly direction. The air was hazy, so it might be floodlights, but I didn&#39;t see any floodlights nearby. The lights didn&#39;t have a trail of light behind, and they had a clear demarcation forward, so it looked like the light was coming from the center of the sphere, not from somewhere outside. When they were closest, they were approx. 200 meters away. I spontaneously went out into the garden because it looked so strange, but am only reporting it now because I read in the local paper that others had seen the same thing.",

I immediately spotted a horizontal row of blue lights with a red-orange orb just below. It came rapidly closer. I called the wife, who came out and watched. It was now almost directly above us. As it passed us we could see its blue lights in front and white lights behind, otherwise everything was black. We could not see the orange ball, not even from behind, as it disappeared with its horizontal row of white lights on the horizon to the north. It moved completely silently all the time. When we saw it from below, it appeared square. I should just add that we are used to seeing airplanes out here, be it small airplanes from Randers Airport, large airliners from Copenhagen to Aalborg and the military&#39;s Jets and helicopters, and they all make noise, whereas this one was completely silent. It wasn&#39;t a glider either, as the speed was like a jet fighter and the size must have been enormous. If I had taken my square wallet and held it outstretched as it flew over us, it would not have been able to cover it. It also did not look like any of the UFOs that I have seen in magazines, television and similar places. It was neither a round plate, disco nor cigar-shaped, but seemed almost square.",

I stopped the car and turned off the engine and got out. The two luminous objects/spheres stood still for a moment, then disappeared to the west at VERY high speed supersonic. There was not a sound to be heard, and in an instant they had disappeared from the sky. It went really fast. I have quite &quot;entertained&quot; both family and friends with my story. I am TOTALLY convinced that it had no natural explanation. No sound oh incredible speed. Now I have seen the documentary on Dr 1 about UFOs and many of the sightings shown here are similar to the ball lightning I saw.",

        "content": "D. 6 August 2022 between 16.00 and 19.00 I saw a UFO/UAP at the triangle here on Bornholm. It was located between Rø and Olsker and hung low in the sky. It consisted of a geometric pattern that I would think was a simple version of a Triquetra. First there was the &quot;flower&quot; with three &quot;petals&quot;. The uppermost petal turned vertically, the other two vertically, on each side, but slightly lower than vertical. At the &quot;crown flower&#39;s&quot; vertical tip, after a while a triangle appeared which connected the tips and finally a circle appeared which also touched the tips of the &quot;flower&quot;. The geometric pattern was invisible, and my friend and I could only see it because the light was bent, or the molecules were different, perhaps more &quot;watered down&quot;. After a while, a small very bright teardrop-shaped light appeared at the tip of the &quot;flower&quot; which traveled very slowly down the left side of the &quot;flower&quot;, further into the center, after which the bright light continued out of the left &quot;leaf&quot; then the light disappeared when it had reached the tip. Noticed that the drop shaped light shone with fine blue and white rays. Then the &quot;flower&quot; and then the triangle disappeared. In the end, only the circle remained, which became completely black, or not completely black, perhaps black as on a negative, where there is somehow light behind. Then the black circle began to fly, but not in a fast straight line, but rather unevenly! Like it was flying in our direction, and then a little to the left, and then a little in our direction again, and then again a little to the left. After a few seconds it disappeared. The entire session was silent. The experience lasted for a few minutes, as if it was in no rush at all.",

The object moved eastwards in a zigzag, where each zigzag is approx. 200-300 meters and the object changed direction at a frequency of approx. 1-1.5 seconds from side to side relative to the direction of flight. There was a plane that crossed the course of the object. The aircraft was a single engine type and was flying from southwest to northeast at a lower altitude than the object and I am sure the pilot saw the object because I noticed the object because of the light when it was directly above me for approx. 700-1000 meters altitude. In an outstretched arm, the object measured like a clasped hand. The object was brightly lit with a reddish glow and was completely silent. The object disappeared on the horizon in a western direction at 23.06. My assessment is that the object increased its speed considerably, since from a size of approx. 2 cm in outstretched arm and 45 degrees above the horizon, until it disappeared in the horizon as a small dot only went approx. 10-12 seconds. I have never experienced anything like it.",

As I live in the country, I stood in our driveway and looked out over the neighbor&#39;s fields. I thought how golden and beautiful it all was, a true delight to the eye, and continued to look at the clouds and the beautiful blue sky. Suddenly I could see what I can only describe as a bright, shiny object with a silvery metallic surface. The object, which was oval in shape, appeared to have no wings and left no jet or contrails in its wake. It was moving very slowly from S to SSW or SW, and seemed like it might be flying slightly at an angle. From my property I can see 2 wind turbines on a neighbour&#39;s field, and the height and location of the object in relation to these turbines was about 2 turbine lengths up from the horizon, i.e. approx. 25 or 35 degrees. (checked the location today.) It all went relatively quickly, in retrospect, but I believe the whole sighting didn&#39;t take much more than maybe 1½ to 2 minutes before the object sadly disappeared. I don&#39;t know if I blinked, the object just disappeared. I was outside later in the afternoon and again several times during the evening hours because the sky was quite clear and bright, but unfortunately it didn&#39;t turn into more shiny objects. I hope you can use my information for something, and of course you are welcome to call or write to me if necessary.",

There I see a clear, red glowing and silent round object heading south with a fighter jet right at its heels. I call my mother and we stand speechless and watch. The object is very bright red, and it has a gliding motion, like when you see a satellite. The fighter is clearly trying to follow the object; the plane roars completely unnaturally, as if the pilot is giving the plane more gas than it can handle. The object disappears after 1-2 min. to the south. Quite a short time later, another fighter plane arrives in exactly the same direction, and a little later again, two more fighter planes - also in exactly the same direction. So we saw this object with 4 fighters following it at short intervals. The object had only a red color, no flashing lights and no sound. It had this very special gliding motion that a plane &quot;of our world&quot; cannot move. It was not a satellite, for that was the object too distinct; it was in our atmosphere. I can best describe the object size to be like if there is a tennis ball hanging in the air 10-15 meters from one. It seemed somewhat larger than the fighter that was right behind it. It may have been a flight exercise, but a feeling in me said otherwise; so there was something &quot;unknown&quot; in our airspace, which obviously had to be looked into more closely, why all those flights after the object.",

However, only 2-5 seconds pass, then there is another strong flash and I can see a white spot (almost like a star) moving from east to west. It sometimes flashes strongly like a flash, almost but not at any specific rate, just like that every once in a while. When I have observed it for 10-15 sec., I can see that next to it there is one more object that flies at the same pace, and every time the first observed object flashes, it almost moves forward in a &quot;notch&quot;, and number 2 object is included, but without flash/blink. Every time it flashes/blinks, it moves forward a good distance without being able to follow its path. Shortly before they disappear from my field of vision above my roof horizon, they change direction to the northwest and change position so that they are alternately in front. Never seen anything like it so that&#39;s why I&#39;m reporting it here.",

        "content": "23 November at 6.55. I&#39;m on my bike on my way to Nykøbing F Station. On Østre Alle, in a direction almost due east, from position 54.766304, 11.893781 (a little before Nykøbing Zoo), I catch sight of 3 white glowing spots. In relation to the road (due east) they lie slightly to the left (approximately 260 degrees), at an angle of approx. 40 degrees. They correspond in size to half the diameter of the hole in a 1 crown held in an outstretched arm. They lie on a perfect line in relation to each other, also in terms of mutual distance. Total &quot;width&quot; corresponds to the width of the 3 middle fingers, held at arm&#39;s length. They are angularly aligned corresponding to a 20 degree downward slope to the right (calculated from a horizontal position). My first thought is that it was Orion&#39;s belt, but I remember the distance being greater. Before I can reflect further, the left light begins to move downwards while the middle one moves upwards until they form a triangle. Just at that point, I&#39;m a little unsure which ones actually move, but believe with 90% certainty that the above is the correct version. In any case, it seems rather strange. From the time I first see the lights, 8-10 seconds pass when they are perfectly aligned. Only then do they move, and it only takes 6-7 seconds for them to form a perfect triangle. This seems to me to &quot;stand still&quot; for another 4-5 seconds, after which the lights continue their movements and become dimmer. After another 10 seconds, I can only see one (the right light). This can be observed for a further 10-15 seconds, after which it also disappears. The lights could be reminiscent of the lights from airplanes, but 3 lights so close together (although the depth distance could not be measured), seems unlikely. Their mutual first stationary location, and then mutual movement pattern, also does not seem likely for aircraft.",

As we stood out in the yard where my bike was parked, we noticed the local disco&#39;s light show in the sky. It should be added that I certainly had a lot to drink, but my friend is almost a teetotaler. Unfortunately, my other mate never got to see it, as it didn&#39;t last more than 5-10 seconds. I&#39;m not entirely sure about the given directions and angle as this is the first time I&#39;ve ever seen anything like it. I have always had a logical way of explaining the inexplicable things I have seen in the sky, but this seems particularly inexplicable to me. Especially the way it swung out into &quot;space&quot; convinced me that it was something special. I have also checked for lightning and the like, but there was nothing to see at dmi. The fact that it could have been the disco light is also ruled out, as it had turned completely over to the opposite side.",

I have not yet been able to come up with any explanation for what my friend and I saw then. We were 10-12 years old, and therefore it may also have been a vivid imagination, but we both saw the same thing and were also then mystified and wondering what it actually was. Description of the observation: Me and my best friend lie on a sea trampoline and look at clouds in the summer, in the middle of the day or in the early afternoon. Clear sunny weather. We look at the &quot;cloud streaks&quot; (condensation trails) that can occur behind aircraft. It was not unusual to see aircraft and/or contrails in the sky. We spot something airplane-like with condensation trails, which is just passing through the sky. It looks like a light gray or white equilateral triangle. We discover to our surprise that the triangle moves &quot;backwards&quot; along the condensation trail. In other words, it does not have the trail behind it like a tail, but in front of it in relation to the direction of movement. In addition, the condensation path &quot;disappears&quot; as the triangle moves along it. As if it &quot;blurs&quot; the path as it moves along it. The triangle did not move with one of the corners as the front point, but with one of the sides of the triangle in front. Hope it makes sense!",

        "content": "I went out to observe Saturn, as it can only be seen early in the morning at this time of year. However, I ended up finding Mercury. I then tried to locate Saturn without the telescope while the telescope was still pointed at Mercury. When I couldn&#39;t find Saturn in the sky, I decided to take a closer look at Mercury, since I had adjusted the telescope to the planet. But when I looked through the telescope, a flying object flew from right to left in my point of view in the telescope. It took the object about 5 seconds before I had to turn the telescope to keep up. So it didn&#39;t fly that fast, and since I was using a 10mm eyepiece, which makes my 8&quot; telescope zoom really far in, it makes objects look faster. Appearance of the object: Properties of the object: Drawing of the object and position in the sky: http ://img99.imageshack.us/my.php?image=bildé027gb5.jpg I hope you guys can figure out what it could possibly be I saw as I don&#39;t think aliens with high enough technology to come here to earth, would fly around in such a craft. However, one can never be sure, but my guess as to what it might have been is a new version of a stealth aircraft or military aircraft, from its shape. Three yellow glowing orbs came into view from west to east - descending towards the ground. I only made eye contact when they came into view in my window. At first I thought they were shooting stars, but they absolutely were not. The 3 orbs were next to each other, but they didn&#39;t stick together - they moved individually They stopped about 50 meters up, they didn&#39;t seem very big. I took my camera outside to take pictures, but I was too shocked/enthralled by the sight to figure out how to turn off the flash, so the pictures haven&#39;t worked - one was just black, one was all white. There were no sounds/machine noise or any other kind of sound from the luminous balls at all, after approx. Half a minute in the same place, where they moved a little between each other, they flew slowly to the south. Approx. 10 minutes later they reappeared from exactly the same direction and took up the same position, approx. 50 meters above my neighbor&#39;s house. After again hanging in the same place, moving a little back and forth, they again flew south. Approx. 100 meters from my position, it looked like they dropped/threw something luminous towards the ground. After this, they again flew slowly to the south and disappeared quietly on the horizon. At no point could I sense any outline/shape on the glowing orbs - it was just 3 yellow glowing round orbs. It was a fantastic sight, I was really taken aback, as I quickly think that I could rule out that it could be something familiar (searchlight, fireball, helicopter, etc.) It really annoys me that I couldn&#39;t find out of operating my camera - hope you can shed light on it.",

The boyfriend sees it immediately and only has time to say &quot;oh yes&quot;, as the object changes direction with the speed of lightning. It makes a few circular turns at high speed, then flies back obliquely at lightning speed, after which it just as quickly disappears in a northwesterly direction! There was only a very small, almost cautious cloud in the sky, where the object disappeared from view for a few seconds and reappeared. It was flying very high up and there was absolutely no sound to be heard, which is why I don&#39;t think it can be some remote controlled object! The speed doesn&#39;t indicate that either!

I always stand and look straight up into the air, and just as I was about to lower my head, something came whizzing over the ridge of my house. The 5 things flew in formation with 2 in front and 3 close behind them. The front two &quot;rocked&quot; slightly to the side while flying. They flew completely silently and yet incredibly fast. They seemed round and flat and their color was like a dull light that faded into a dark outline/contour of the UFO. Unfortunately, it was all over in approx. 5 seconds. I would give my right arm to be allowed to experience it again. Will you email me back about whether there are other sightings from around the Køgebugt/Greve area yesterday?",

        "content": "we were sitting in a garden when I catch an object in my field of vision.. and react to this... it&#39;s not quite round... almost resembled a cloud like thing.. thought it was an aurora I had seen. .It had a greenish/white glow...it &quot;drove&quot; like in a lane..but quite fast at times. When I write in orbit, it is because, after 2 hours of observation, it seemed rather &quot;mechanically made&quot;. with... still hovering in some kind of orbit.. like it was following me home... eventually it was over my house. I think it seemed strange and can&#39;t really be explained.. If it was someone shining with a searchlight.. there would be some kind of cone of light under the object.. and then it would have stayed in the same place right? At least I think so, it would... there was no noise associated with the object. All 3 of us were very curious to know what it might be. could be, we had all seen. There were a lot of stars.. but it was hardly a star? who behaved like that? Have you heard of a similar phenomenon that informed the evening in question? (Friday night). I know it sounds artificial.. and if it was a ufo.. it wouldn&#39;t be there for that long.. or would it? But the fact that it kind of came with me.. seems quite strange to me.. inexplicable anyway. My thoughts also went to whether there was a company which, as it were, has an &quot;advertising light&quot; which operates in a certain way, but I don&#39;t think there is one in Odense. In addition, it changed direction a little.. and was fast at times.. vupti it was somewhere else.. as you had turned off the switch to the light, and the light was gone... so fast. Hope you can give an explanation.. we tried to photograph it.. but it didn&#39;t want to be in the picture.. just darkness. We therefore cannot document our observation, but hope you have heard of similar observations.",

        "content": "I live near Aalborg Airport in Vadum. A Nato exercise was supposed to have started the day before, but not many planes had arrived in Aalborg yet. One evening, I was sitting on the sofa, I could see a plane coming in for landing from east to west, as they always do. But this plane slowed in midair. Then it had to be a helicopter. But what was such a thing doing in the approach route and why was it standing still there. Those helicopters tend to do that. So I left the couch and went out into the garden. It was flashing red and white. But there was no sound from it. Why did it hang there? Now 5 minutes had passed. since it stopped. Then I saw another &quot;helicopter&quot;. Completely white, like a satellite. It flew from south to north east of my house. There was no sound either. It was now reasonably close. Therefore, I should be able to hear something. But no. Then the first one began to fly south towards Aalborg. Also without sound. I have tried to film the first one. It&#39;s not a good video, but you can see that there is something flashing faintly and not a sound. I find it strange that you couldn&#39;t hear sound from both of them. I know that if the wind is from the west, you cannot hear anything when what you see is in the east. But I&#39;m used to seeing both planes and helicopters on a daily basis. And it looks so strange. It must not stand still in the approach route. I bet those in the tower out at the airport could see it with binoculars. Hope I can get an answer to what it was.",

        "content": "I was on my way home from my girlfriend, who lives in Brøndby Strand. I myself live in Hvidovre, and get off at Friheden st. I usually talk to my girlfriend the whole way home from her, and that&#39;s all and as it usually is. But purely by chance, I look out over the &quot;sea&quot;. So you can&#39;t see the sea from there, but that&#39;s the way that the sea lies (south). I see a bright light on the horizon, and think that it&#39;s probably just a plane heading straight for me, but which will turn around in a little while to land at Kastrup airport. But I think the light looked a bit strange when you consider that it was an airplane, so I stand for a while on &quot;Menelaos boulevard&quot; in Hvidovre and look at the light. I then ask my girlfriend if she can see it from her apartment in Brøndby Strand, and she could! From both her angle and mine, it was a very bright light. You couldn&#39;t see the shape of the object hanging in the air at all. Suddenly the light started flashing all sorts of colors. Yellow, blue, green and white, and not only that, I could suddenly see it moving to one of the sides, and there I was really scared inside! My girlfriend couldn&#39;t see it move from her apartment, but she could still see it, and all the different colors. So the movement I then must have been away or towards my girlfriend as we saw the object from two different angles. And the angle she saw it from, she couldn&#39;t see it moving because it might be flying straight at her, or straight away from her. But after 2 minutes approx. then it started moving a lot! One thing I will never forget is that it picked up speed and I could see it more clearly than before. It had approx. 5 lights below it, which shone in 5 directions below it, and it leaned slightly to the side as it flew at the slightly higher speed. And the most eerie thing was that for a few seconds I could see something that looked like rotations from it. For the first time I could see the saucer-shaped shape. It&#39;s probably one of the scariest things I&#39;ve ever seen in my life! Sure, I watch the History Channel with ancient aliens and ufo hunters, but I&#39;ve also always been realistic and thought that it&#39;s just movie tricks. But after what I saw today, I saw no doubt that there really is something out there. My girlfriend could also see it rotating from her apartment and the 5 lights below it. I also tried to think what it could be if I didn&#39;t have to think flying saucer. But it wasn&#39;t a helicopter! We have got a medical helicopter in the capital area. But I don&#39;t see why it would fly back and forth, zig-zagging in the air. Furthermore, it does not have such a bright light that goes in all directions at once. I&#39;ve also seen it before in the evening, that is the helicopter, and this didn&#39;t look like it at all! A long way off! An aviator is also completely out of the question. So I really don&#39;t see what it would be. It&#39;s the scariest thing in my life, but exciting too. Hope to see it again! I actually tried to film it, but my mobile didn&#39;t bother to film as there was almost no power left + I was talking to my girlfriend and it was just so sad that there was no power! But I really don&#39;t understand if there was no one but me and my boyfriend who saw it .. it was really crazy.",

The distance is impossible to estimate, it could have been 50 meters up or several kilometers. The object appears clearly defined spherical, without any color change or shape change. The size is approx. 3-4 mm in an outstretched arm at the start of observation. The object disappears in a northerly direction within 10-15 seconds, it &quot;disappears&quot; in the same way as a satellite can when the light fades. During the observation, a commercial airliner flies over the area, from east to west. My first thoughts were on a satellite/ISS, but both speed and brightness were too high for this. My next thought was a balloon or other airborne object, which might fit the wind direction that day (loose string on the mast indicated the wind direction). However, I would again assess the speed as being too high in relation to the wind strength, just as a balloon or bag would probably give the impression of shape-shifting. At the end of the observation, I tried to catch the object in binoculars standing by the window, but without success.",

When we look up there again several minutes later, the object has moved a little bit, and now we discovered that it was moving forward very slowly and not in a straight line! It flew slightly to the right and then to the left. It flew faster and faster, but we managed to get in and get my mom and sister so they could see it too. As they came, the object flew over us and all of a sudden changed to 3 small lights and a large one in front. IT WASN&#39;T A PLANE! It flashed in all sorts of colors and I think it was shaped like a square with a very bright tip. There is no way it could have been a plane, helicopter or anything else, as it made no noise. It was a completely windless evening and we could hear no sound. There was also no tail or anything after the object. It disappeared to the north, still flashing…",

I mean this light was a few kilometers from me but it was very powerful. Afterwards came a less powerful light, in the same yellow/orange shade. As I drove on towards Hoven, I looked for the light and guessed it occasionally. I heard no sounds associated with the light. At the roundabout after Hoven, I drove towards Ølgod, and approx. 1 km. after the roundabout, on the west side of the road, over the fields, I spot what looks like a small airplane with fire in it. It&#39;s in the same direction as I&#39;m driving, and seems to be about to land. I drive parallel to it for a few minutes, then my path turns and I see it disappear behind the trees.

When I was in the 4th grade, I entered a private school in Næstved, which is why I had to cycle to a small village called Bøgesø and from there take the train to Næstved. On the road from Bøgesø to Everdrup, there is a long, small settlement, Flintemose, and some forest, and after the 2 localities, there is a clear section with a long, steep hill, which everyone, adults and children, pulled their bikes up. The road is called Flintemosevej. A summer day in August or September 1959, on the way home from school, approx. at 14.45 plus/minus ½ hour, I thus pulled my bike up that hill. It was a lovely summer day without a cloud in the sky. When I had reached 2/3 up the hill, I looked back and saw some of my mates who had just arrived at the foot of the hill and were getting off their bikes. Approx. 15 sec. later I absentmindedly looked up at the sky to the north and suddenly saw a giant pipe in the sky. It was completely shiny and completely smooth without any openings etc. protrusion to see. The ends were blunt, and it seems to me that the ends were a little narrower than the middle. There were no sounds to be heard from it, and there was no smoke or electricity. fire out of the object. I looked at the object for 2-3-4 seconds, then turned my head to see if my companions had seen it too, but apparently they hadn&#39;t, so I quickly turned my head back and looked up at the sky again - but now the object was gone! I looked all over the sky, but there was no sign of it in the completely cloudless sky. And there were no other things to see either. It is obviously difficult to judge the size of the object as there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, but from how clear and sharp I saw it I would guess it was 3-400m away and as big as 2 jumbo jets. But the size is obviously uncertain. However, I perceived it as very large and as a good distance away. Did it fly while I was watching it? I have often thought about that afterwards - but I don&#39;t actually know. IF it flew, it came approx. from the east in the longitudinal direction of the object. It had a slightly inclined position in the sky. The sighting probably happened many years ago, but I think I remember it as if it had happened a month ago. I can thus also remember who I follow. told about it, their names and what they answered me. I&#39;m not aware of anyone else seeing it.",

It wasn&#39;t a plane, nor a satellite - I see those every day - and I often see shooting stars, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before. Maybe you know what this is?

Suddenly I saw that a little north of Læsø there was a strange light which descended and flew up, suddenly, when it was down, it moved sideways and in an oblique path. I studied the phenomenon for a few minutes as it appeared to be approaching Frederikshavn. Suddenly it rose at a tremendous speed and disappeared over Sæby. It was now 06:46, so all the electricity in Frederikshavn went out. I started my emergency station to see if anyone else had power. It turned out that the power had gone all the way down to Viborg, perhaps Esbjerg. I got the idea that the object had refueled and thereby extinguished the Danmark family.",

        "content": "A married couple living in 8210 Århus V. observed a light in the sky on 16 June 2008 and reported this to Flyvertaktisk Kommando, FTK, in Karup, from which SUFOI has received the observation report: &quot;Last night on 16 June 2008, both my wife and I saw in absolutely sober condition an unusual phenomenon of light.” “I happened to look out at 0.45 and saw up in the air a spot of light the size of a sixth of the moon and of the same warm color as the flame of a candle. A moment later more followed until there were a total of five in a row. There weren&#39;t the colored and flashing lights that planes usually carry. The light was equally strong towards us, above us and away from us. The strangest thing, however, was that there was no sound at all. It&#39;s quiet here and we can usually hear airliners going so high up that they are only seen as a dot.&quot; &quot;In terms of speed, it could be a plane. They moved from SW towards NE - with a little good will in the direction of Tirstrup. The question then is whether five silent planes / helicopters with very strong lighting arrived at Tirstrup at 0.55?&#39; the place and time in question had planes in the air that could explain the sighting. SUFOI comment: The wind direction at the time in question appears to have been approx. from SV, which strengthens a presumption that - combined with the other report - it could probably be small vamluft balloons.",

The object captured by chance via screen shot is grey, clear and oval-shaped exactly like the tic-tac. we have seen and heard so much about. Second report: Is shaped like a luminous point, which forms a triangle between two of the points, one corner point in the lower right corner is further associated with 4 bright points, of which it is very luminous, the perimeter around this powerful spot-like light changes color to bluish. This object appears unnaturally low and in 40 minutes it moves across the horizon from SE 175 degrees to S 205 degrees and out of sight. The object in the second observation is seen with the naked eye as an unnaturally strong light in the sky, and this observation could only be recorded and documented via the telescope combined with the zoom from the iPhone 12. This was video recorded for 39 min. together with the girlfriend. The object in the first observation was with a mobile phone and is probably the most startling. I have video plus photo and a witness as documentation, and I would really like help to clarify what we observed",

On my way back to my apartment, something in the sky catches my attention out of the corner of my eye. What I observe is, at first glance, 8 - 10 lights in orange color, which in brightness far exceed stars and which move in formation from west to east. I observe due south. Distance to these lights and their speed I dare not yet guess. Naturally, I would send the video as a file to Ole Henningsen as well. Unfortunately, it is 27.2 MB and my mail does not allow sending files larger than 25 MB. It can possibly be packed in a way so that it can be done anyway. I have no experience with this, which is why I am waiting a little longer. You at SUFOI are of course welcome to contact me if you have any questions or think I or the witnesses can contribute further. In fact, I would appreciate an explanation on this, which is why I certainly hope to hear from you.",

It came at high speed, but not faster than we could see it from the car without being particularly focused on the sky. It would be fun if others have seen the same thing.",

After crossing the center of my field of vision, all four objects disappear completely, just as suddenly as they appeared. I would immediately estimate the height of the objects when they disappear to be 35-40° seen from the car. My roommate, who I made aware of the phenomenon, also saw it quite clearly. Therefore, I am quite sure that it was not light reflections from cars coming from behind. At the same time, it was still quite bright and clear, so I am also reasonably sure that it was not a plane that possibly disappeared in the haze. There were also no flashing lights, as you normally see on planes.",

I ran across the street to see the object again, but there it was gone. It is always difficult to estimate height, but my immediate guess is that it was approx. 100 meters up The object looked very strange, and is a little difficult to describe. Two balls with a spike is the closest we could agree to describe it. The object was black and there were sun reflections in it. We talked about the possibility that it was something that had been sent up from the 1 May party in Fælledparken. However, we immediately thought it was too big and flew too fast to be.

        "content": "One day at the end of May 1993 (unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember the exact date) at approx. 22.30 I was sitting at my typewriter when I suddenly get a strange feeling that someone is looking at me. I lived quite far out in the country at the time, and went to look out of the windows (if there was anyone outside). Above the forest, which I have a clear view of across the open field, some small white stars were floating around between the trees. I can&#39;t say how big they were as distance judgment is not my forte. But the size of the biggest stars we can see here from Earth. There were approx. 1 km over to the forest, I want to shoot. I went outside to take a closer look at the stars, but couldn&#39;t go very far as I had a sleeping child inside the house. It was a VERY beautiful sight. I stood looking at it for a long time. It&#39;s completely quiet there. After a while, a larger object came into view above the treetops. It looked like a ball with a ring around it, and pulsated in red, green (blue) and white. The ball floated over the trees, making a strange pattern. Still no sound. I remember looking at the clock and seeing that a quarter of an hour had passed. My boyfriend at the time comes home from work and sees the lights too. The bullet stopped for a moment and then disappeared over the Jels lakes. It was an indescribably beautiful experience that I would not have been without. I always had a nice feeling of &quot;calm&quot;. In addition to the observation, I would just like to add: We were very &quot;impressed&quot; by what we had seen and contacted a &quot;UFO connoisseur&quot; who lives/lived near Lunderskov. Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember his name. He came and took a report, but unfortunately I don&#39;t know where it ended up. I am also very grateful to him because he came out and talked to us (and at the same time helped us get rid of our &quot;ghost&quot;). And because he took us seriously when others just thought we were crazy.",

        "content": "At approximately 21.20 me and my parents drive in the direction of Grenaa along the A16 highway in Djursland. On a ridge near the &quot;town&quot; of Langkastrup, we suddenly see 2 pulsating objects in a northeasterly direction. The objects are whitish, round and appear to be pulsating. In the background and above the objects, brief flashes of light that look like lightning are observed, but we cannot see the &quot;lightning branch&quot; itself. We descend into a valley, and the objects, however, disappear from view. In the meantime, we are talking about the fact that a week or 2 ago my father and mother observed exactly the same phenomenon. When we then come out into an open area, we now see 3 objects. They are VERY clear against the dark sky. There are some stars and the moon lies behind the observers and is &quot;half&quot;. It is very clear to see that the objects are not illuminated, but emit the powerful light themselves. The mysterious &quot;background flashes&quot; are constantly observed throughout the incident. A little later, 2 of the objects suddenly disappear. It looks like they &quot;fade&quot; into the background, but still quite quickly. We find this very strange, and when a roundabout appears with a road heading towards the objects, we decide to drive towards them. We are maybe 1-2 kilometers from home and we are considering whether to pick up my video camera and regular camera. However, we decide to continue towards the lights. The number of objects varies greatly, and 3 times 7-8 lights are observed at once. Several cars follow us, although I can&#39;t be sure that it&#39;s after the lights. At one point we pass a lake, and the water is clearly illuminated by the objects. 2 of the objects, (appeared to be the smallest) are very close to each other. The other 6 hover around them in an irregular cluster. The direction is directly north or slightly northeast of us now. I estimate the height from approx. 3x the tree line and 20-25 tree lines up to the top object. We are now on the Nordkystvejen northwest of Allingaabro, and another roundabout appears. My father says the lights are over the &quot;Hevring camp&quot;, a military area. Therefore, we take a road at the roundabout that goes towards Hevring. The 7 lights have now disappeared and a single one remains. The remaining light now looks like it is falling just as quietly into an underlying forest, and we turn around and drive back. Arriving at the roundabout northwest of Allingaabro, we now observe the objects in an easterly direction, a good distance away. They are still very powerful and pulsating, and the strange &quot;lightning flashes&quot; are observed again. We turn left onto the Nordkystvejen, which just goes in an easterly direction. Since we can easily get back home from this, we decide to follow the lights a bit. It looks like they are quite a distance away and we decide to drive home. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know what it was, but it was beautiful! Personal background and information: I am very interested in storms, and have therefore acquired a video camera and camera to &quot;capture&quot; lightning. I remember having a discussion earlier in the day with a meteorologist from Berlin. We talked about the possibility of thunderstorms the following afternoon, so I followed the lightning radar closely. However, no thunderstorms came near Denmark all day, and as I said, no lightning had occurred between 21-22. My mother works at Gl. Estrup, which is right near Auning, and we then live on Gl. Estrup. 2 observations have been made of the objects from this location at other times.",

My first thought was that it must be a balloon. But it was as if at times it stood still, and at other times moved. It actually looked like a star, but they don&#39;t move visibly. Besides, they don&#39;t shine so brightly, so you can see them on a sunny April day at noon. I probably watched the object for 5-10 min while it got fainter (maybe went higher) and then a big cloud drifted under it and I didn&#39;t see it again. As many as 3 large airliners passed by the object, they must have seen something in rows......or what.......",

The light in the 5 objects varied in intensity and they moved completely silently. The 5 objects held their formation across the sky until the lights disappeared behind clouds. I managed to take a very blurry picture, but due to the long exposure, it is quite difficult to see. Shortly after the 5 objects have disappeared, another appears in the southwest and behaves like the other 5 across the sky, still completely silent.",

But then 2 more came, and they flew in a straight line with approx. 2-3 meters distance between each other. The light was strong and yellowish. And my first thought was: That&#39;s not how planes fly. I don&#39;t know how high they were when they disappeared, when they disappeared behind some buildings. But high up they were. There was another person who was waiting for the bus too - I didn&#39;t get to talk to him because my bus was coming - but I could see from him that he saw the same thing. Because he looked at me wonderingly. I have never seen such lights in the sky before and I know what a plane in the night sky looks like. These two weren&#39;t planes, but what they were, I don&#39;t know. Can anyone tell what it is or have an idea?",

I remember similar phenomenon being shown on television 10-15 years ago from Belgium (I think it was Sat1) showing this. I have no idea what it is, I don&#39;t think it can be eg F16 as there was no sound, satellites maybe, but having worked in the weather service (military) I have never seen satellites fly like that.

At first the ball moves a little closer, but suddenly it moves at high speed vertically up to a height where it stands still for a longer time and here almost looks like a normal star (however, it shines brighter and more orange than the real stars. 2-3 times, while it &quot;stands still&quot; in the sky, it makes a quick movement to the same side, only to quickly move back to the same position again. We keep an eye on it and get the camera out, but unfortunately only when it is well up in the sky After about 8-10 minutes it fades away and eventually it&#39;s out of sight maybe behind clouds(?) It&#39;s been over a week now and we&#39;ve run through all the logical explanations without getting any wiser.In my opinion, its trajectory, speed and its very spherical shape do not connect with a hot air balloon..",

In my field of vision from right to left. At first I was afraid that it was a plane that had caught fire, but the speed of the &quot;fireball&quot; and the fact that no sound was heard disproved this. The object was moving at an uneven pace - medium to slow - mainly from right to left, but also apparently vertically. A constant fire-like light in the form of a round dot. The brightness was like a smaller burning fire in the sky. When I went to get a camera, the light &quot;went out&quot;. (This was observed exclusively by my wife). She described it as if &quot;the fire suddenly went out high in the air&quot;. She is unsure whether she glimpsed a slight smoke development. No signs of crash, explosion or anything else. The light/fire quickly faded in just a few seconds. Not so dark yet at this time - Very clear weather. I&#39;m a little unsure about compass direction (not my strong point). But observed the object while standing with my gaze directed straight ahead to the horizon - the object was slightly to the right in my field of vision and then moved centrally so that it was almost exactly in the center of my field of vision from the center of the window in the apartment.",

        "content": "I skimmed your brochure on celestial phenomena and what I saw did not match any of the examples. I live far out in the countryside in Midtlolland - there are no street lights here, so you can see a lot of the sky. This was neither a satellite in orbit, an airplane, a star, comet or meteor - nor laser light. I have seen these phenomena before and can recognize them well. I went out to the yard yesterday approx. at midnight and my attention was drawn to what I at first thought was a bright bright star or planet standing almost vertically above my head. Got to thinking it couldn&#39;t be Venus because it&#39;s not that high in the sky. It stood - like a star - in the same place without moving, but began to shine brighter and brighter until there was an &quot;explosion of light&quot; or a very powerful flash of light, much bigger than the &quot;star&quot; itself. Then it immediately began to move, at the same time as the light faded. I followed its movement approx. 5-10 degrees, and then it was gone. I have observed almost the same phenomenon once more within the last year. Then it was just lower towards the horizon and moving from a northerly direction to the east. I know that there was a strong meteor impact on Lolland approx. a year ago - I saw that too - and it was not the same phenomenon.",

Unfortunately, I can&#39;t remember the date and time. We live in Silkeborg by Gødvad. One afternoon at approx. 1 p.m. my daughter comes in. I ask her what she has been doing out there. Then she tells me this story. I had my daughter draw a drawing of her experience. She drew a round UFO with a ladder going down. She told while she was drawing that it was a man and a lady who helped them up into the UFO and down again. I talked to the friend&#39;s parents if they had heard anything about a UFO, they hadn&#39;t. I asked the kindergarten if they had had any games with this topic, but no. I often wonder if it was a vivid imagination or if it was true. I saved the drawing, but haven&#39;t been able to find it since.",

She tells me that because it has more speed than airplanes normally do. I go to the window and see a bright red circular light - like a parachute rocket on New Year&#39;s Eve. I can see it speeding up and rush over to our patio door as I say &quot;if it&#39;s a plane it&#39;s making noise&quot;. I unlock the door and go out onto the patio and look up, it&#39;s like it&#39;s slowing down sharply and it stops before it&#39;s passed our house. I call my girlfriend as I think it&#39;s a bit spooky, she looks up, but quickly disappears back inside. It just stays standing for approx. 30 seconds - all the time with the same light intensity, but then it increases sharply in a straight easterly direction. After 15 seconds I can&#39;t see it anymore. I&#39;ve always liked watching aviators and was good at spotting the types, but this one I&#39;ve never seen before, such a bright red light with a halo around it, and with that speed it disappeared - without smoke or sound .",

I immediately find it difficult to identify the sound and think that it is probably some people on their way home from the city. What I just wondered about was that there wasn&#39;t a conversation going on. It took approx. 3 minutes before a strong beam of light shone through our window. When I woke up the following morning, I checked DMI&#39;s website to see if lightning had been recorded over Funen during the night, but there wasn&#39;t. I don&#39;t know what it could have been. But I&#39;m sure it&#39;s light from upstairs, as we live at 2nd floor height, while our bedroom window is a skylight that leans up to the sky. After the beam of light, the rumble I heard first intensified, so it sounded like there were several people working on something. It&#39;s hard to describe that sound, but it was like someone was standing and working on some different things some distance away (in a nearby green space). I have not yet heard from neighbors if they have observed anything.",

It burned from it. We saw it from when it was a glimmer on the horizon until it disappeared over the airport towards Sweden. We got really high when it was clear that it was a spherical thing with fire in it. We can&#39;t figure out what it was though! Has anyone else seen anything? I have a few photos of the bullet. After a while it occurred to us to get a camera, but it just looks like a small dot on the iphone. Cool experience. It seemed bigger.",

Whether the lights are double triangles, as can be seen on film, I have subsequently become unsure, as I can see that the triangles are only visible when the camera can&#39;t figure out how to focus. But I have not been able to reproduce this effect. I have no idea what it was we saw. There was no sound about it, so if they were planes, they must have been very high up. If it was a plane, then the light might be reflections from the sun, since it is not that long after sunset. And the sun might well be shining on planes that were a few kilometers up. However, the size of the lights was so large that I somewhat doubt this. The video camera is a Panasonic NV-GC280, which has a 3.0-30 mm Leica optic. (This corresponds to an SLR with 42-430mm optics). I would very much like to clarify what it was we saw.",

        "content": "New Year 2013/2014 in Copenhagen was fantastic, and the rockets went off from midnight. Henad at approx. Between 00:45 and 01:15 both my son and I became aware that something was different. I was standing in the living room with my sister looking out over the meat town and up into the sky and saw many beautiful colors from the rockets and my son was in the room facing the yard with his mates. But he happened to be looking out the window at the same time I spotted the strange light in the sky. At first we thought it might be the Japanese paper gizmos that you send up with fire in them, but they burn up and don&#39;t move to the side in the same way that this strange light suddenly did. I followed it intensely with my eyes and it was flaming in a kind of oval shape and in the middle of the oval shape, it was black. Between the flaming outline and the inner part of it, it was separated by another black ring, so you actually got two oval flaming shapes in one big one. It wasn&#39;t until it suddenly changed direction exactly opposite of where it was going that I thought... this is not normal at all. The pace was ultra slow. It came closer and closer and I could now clearly see the flaming oval shapes and opened my window on the 5th floor and there was no sound. By then the rockets were dwindling in number and the oval shape was even more apparent. It was headed over the ridge of the building I lived in, and suddenly my son looked out the window and said, what the hell is that? He saw the change of direction once more and berated it completely like me afterwards. He observed no engine noise and stood for a long time watching it in the balcony doorway. Suddenly it disappeared in a new direction, but at high speed and gone it was. We both knew there were some smaller planes filming all the glory over Copenhagen on New Year&#39;s Eve, but... there was no sound... and no, we weren&#39;t drunk. So whatever it was we saw, it wasn&#39;t exactly ordinary.",

We saw other airliners passing its path higher up, making noise and flashing as usual. The light created gave a star shape (8-star), the slanted tips were long and bright white, the horizontal tips were short and blue, and the vertical ones were barely visible. We stood on the balcony, which faces west-southwest and followed it from west to east, and the light disappeared just as it passed the ridge of the roof. SUFOI&#39;s comment: The observation is probably due to the International Space Station ISS, which can be seen passing over the southern sky at times. The space station appears in the night sky as a powerful light that moves slowly in a path from west to east. On 4 May, the ISS could be seen from Gudme in the time period at 23:13:05 (appearance) and until 23:16:18 (disappearance). The ISS appeared to the west-southwest at an altitude of 10 degrees above the horizon and disappeared to the south-southeast at an altitude of 36 degrees.",

        "content": "Yesterday, approx. at 23:55 me and my friends made an unusual observation. We found ourselves at Smukfest Copenhagen. The Petshop Boys had just gone into full swing playing their music. My friend knows that I tend to look up in the air and see various patterns and shapes in the clouds, so she made a joke about it during the concert, which automatically made me look up at the starry sky. All of a sudden, two bright lights shine. Their circumference is considerably larger than the stars in the sky, and they also shine much brighter, so they stand out quickly. I alert my friends and also people standing around us to the strange light phenomenon that shines unusually bright in the sky. Suddenly the focus is off the concert, which is playing out there, and up into the air. The two powerful lights suddenly begin to move. They fly at an ok high speed into the air, side by side, but not in a straight line, as, for example, a plane would. They circulate almost straight out, and follow each other in their movements. Suddenly they disappear over the horizon. It was an amazing sight! Now it&#39;s the next day, and I just sat and wrote with my other friend, who also saw it, about it. I have read through some of your reports to see if there were others who had seen something similar. and your conclusions based on it. You mentioned something about satellites flying next to each other, but from what I could understand they were supposed to be moving at a slow speed. These two bright lights we saw yesterday were moving at a much faster pace, and it also doesn&#39;t look like what we saw when I search other people&#39;s satellite footage, which could be mistaken for something unidentified. Smukfest Copenhagen took place at Amager, out on 10øren. The phenomenon took place approx. at 23:55-23:58. It is the first time in my life that I have experienced something so unusual.",

On the upper side it was black dented and shiny, on the lower side there were windows all around with light in. It was not possible to see through these windows. In a split second there is a sound like when you strike a bamboo stick through the air, and it disappears into the stars with a trail of fire in a few seconds.

The music stage was extremely brightly lit and it seemed as if this attracted the object&#39;s attention. It then turned 90 degrees and disappeared with lightning speed towards the SW. At no time did the object have any trail of fire or any other form of color or light. It was difficult to focus directly on the object because of its bright light, (like a kind of small sun) but by letting the eye focus a little next to the object, I could see the outline, and it without a doubt looked like the UFO that you use in your logo, albeit always slightly tilted. My wife and another festival goer also saw the object, but could not explain the phenomenon either, as it did not look like or behave like any other commonly known flying object It must be said that all three of us were perfectly sober (we had small children with us).",

It moves very slowly straight down, and then starts to slope slightly to the east, before approx. 15.59 disappears. It seems as if the black central core is burning up, because it gets smaller and smaller before it disappears, and only the fire remains - then the fire dies out. I have never seen anything like this and wondered if it could be a meteor or similar, however my boyfriend claims they burn up much faster than was the case here.",

There were small short beams of light around the object, just like you see with small halogen spots, don&#39;t know if it&#39;s one&#39;s eyelashes that make it look like that. It seemed to be way up and if that is correct my son thinks it was flying faster than a normal airplane, I find it hard to judge speed myself. The object flew in a straight line, no noise was heard from it. My son is convinced it&#39;s some secret military hardware, I don&#39;t know if it was &quot;just&quot; a plane flying with some special light for some reason, but he says planes MUST flash green , red and perhaps white, and the object had a constant and very strong white light all the time. Is it correct that airplanes should flash?",

I assumed at first that it was a plane, but then became a bit doubtful when the light suddenly became a bit more &quot;foggy&quot;/diffuse, and lights (cones of light??) started to rotate around the foggy point. Then we stopped the car and the driver got out to observe while I stayed inside - observing. It seemed like the thing was standing still as it had become &quot;foggy&quot;/diffuse. However, I wanted to continue, as I was not completely pressured by the situation. So we drove on through Levring towards Kjellerup, but did not see the object. However, the assessment is not that it is a &quot;flying saucer&quot;, but still believes that it can be a plane. Now, I&#39;m not entirely sure what kind of lights might be on planes... but could it not have been a rotor flashing light on the bottom of the plane? That could explain it with those light cones. The plane has probably flown into a cloud, so the light becomes more diffuse/foggy - but the light cones from the rotor flashing are more clearly visible??",

And sure enough, when we looked to the west in the direction of Ringkøbing (there are 20 km. to Ringkøbing), we saw an oval luminous flying object flying around in a circular route (slightly changed position, not much, but same circular flight route ). It was 2-3 times the diameter of the moon and was surrounded by some haze/fog/cloudiness, yet very clearly oval UFO shaped (the way you imagine a flying saucer to be). The circular route was an &quot;oblique circular route up and down&quot;, but at the same time away from us and towards us (the light was strongest when it was towards us). We kept an eye on it for a little over an hour, and when we went to bed a little past 2, it was still there (it could also be seen from the attic window and was still circling in the same area). There was no sound or anything strange. We have speculated a lot about what it could be. But we cannot find any logical explanation for that light (the nearest small village in that direction is 8 km. away and not in a direct line behind the UFO, and the nearest big city Ringkøbing is 20 km. away, there are no shops, companies or laser searchlights in that direction. There are only fields and farms and a gravel pit nearby. About 15 km away is a grass drying factory, but otherwise nothing. It flew up in the open sky about 40 degrees above the horizon (in between its orbit behind some trees by our neighbor&#39;s house), Its speed was quiet and calm, but at almost the same speed. It&#39;s hard to say how far away it was, but it was quite a distance. (We live on one of the highest points in the area and can see all the way to Nr. Lyngvig Lighthouse in clear weather. But the UFO was not in the same direction as Nr. Lyngvig Lighthouse, more north-west. the direction fits it.) Moreover, the weather was not clear, and the lighthouse could not be seen due to fog and cloudy weather. It wasn&#39;t stellar either. Whether it really was a flying saucer in the literal sense can be hard to dismiss... I wonder if anyone else has seen it?? It could be interesting to hear.",

Might look like a big airplane, but not that far away. It is constantly moving across the northern sky towards the east. After I have observed the light for a few minutes, the heck takes off at the 2 outermost dots, and flies very quickly towards another luminous dot to the east. There they fly around for a while, while they seem to investigate something in the sky in a different direction. The last dot approaches, and then they fly together again towards the east. The time was about the year that President Buch was here in our longitudes. I don&#39;t think he was in Denmark, but maybe in one of the other Nordic countries. I wondered if it could be Airforce 1 with 2 fighters next to it, but it just couldn&#39;t really fit with the actual light in the sky. There was nothing that flashed or glowed red. Bright light only. As I sit here and replay the episode in my head, I vaguely remember that there was a lot of noise, like when a jet engine accelerates, but it just didn&#39;t quite match the speed of the lights.",

As the &quot;falling&quot; comes further down and more clearly in shape, I can see that it is at least not a parachutist, and I also find it difficult to imagine that it is a bird, partly because of its size, not heard of raptors of this size over Copenhagen, partly because of a verticality in what was observed, which was more reminiscent of a parachutist than a soaring raptor looking for prey. After following the observed for a while, while in a hovering downward movement it calmly descends further and further down, I run up to my wife, we live on the 4th floor, and call her to the window. Together we can observe a black spot in the sky that is now rising to eventually disappear.

At about 18.20 Ermelundsstien near Lyngby (2800) immediately south of the Statoil tank on Klampenborgvej I saw a UFO (UFO for me to see, as I have never been able to find a &quot;natural/rational&quot; explanation for the sighting). I was tricked by the sound of a plane which made me look up. (I have always been interested in planes, have been gliding myself for many years, and it is a completely normal behavior for me to glance up when a plane passes. The one in question was a turbo-prop, probably the F50. At the same time that i saw the plane i saw something almost vertical above me which appeared spherical and metallic colored, probably lower than the turbo prop plane (but hard to judge).Both (plane &amp; ufo) changed heading to some extent during the sighting, the plane to a more westerly direction, the UFO to a more northerly direction. Their &quot;course crossings&quot; occurred at an approximately 90 degree angle. The UFO turned to N/NW (estimated) and disappeared at a similar high speed, as the further it came away, looking more and more like an oval shape (may be correct, although I originally perceived a spherical shape, it was almost vertical from below).During the course, when it rapidly moves away, I perceive its flight as with alternating speed, or like dolphin flight.Without timing, I perceive the course as lasting 15-20 seconds, maybe a little more.",

The object appeared to have sharp rectangular shapes and appeared completely black against the sun. I would like to attach a drawing of the sun and the object that shows the position of the object, as well as the size in relation to the sun, but do not know how to do it from this page. I tried to photograph it with the mobile camera at full zoom without success. I can&#39;t see it in the pictures, probably due to the camera&#39;s poor resolution when zooming, as well as too small a focal length. What can I have seen, are there stationary satellites in the form that can be seen from the earth with the naked eye?",

She followed me out to the car, and we spotted a strong light, almost like a searchlight, which is directed towards the sky. We talked briefly about who and why this powerful light almost down by the fjord. Then I drove, still wondering about the light that I expected would disappear behind me when I passed the spot where the searchlight was. But soon after I discovered that the beam of light had now turned into something that looked like a luminous ball, white with a reddish tinge. For a brief moment I probably got a bit hot around the ears, but then convinced myself that if it was something unknown, supernatural, I probably couldn&#39;t do much anyway! However, I remember locking the car doors. From Vester Assels, where my mother lived and still lives, and home in Øksendal, where I live with my wife and our 3 children, who lived at home at the time, there is approx. 30 minutes drive and about 20 km. The ball of light followed me exactly the same distance on my right side, despite me turning and following the road home several times. Of course, I thought a lot on the trip, but I wasn&#39;t afraid at all, trusting then as now that my Creator would take care of me and make sure I got home to my family. When I reached home in the yard, I ran in after my wife and our children and told them to hurry up and get out. They all saw the ball of light, which for a short moment almost stood still, as if it wanted to say thank you for tonight or something like that, - then at high speed set a course for Sallingsund, and it was then out of sight. The family were naturally wide-eyed and amazed when I told them that I had been followed home all the way from Grandma&#39;s by the ball of light. We agreed that it had probably come to look after me, so I got home safely. We also agreed not to tell anyone about the episode, because of course we would be seen as clairvoyant, crazy or whatever. No one would believe us. My wife and I have been into the phenomenon and talked about it once since. What it was, I don&#39;t know and almost don&#39;t care, but we know what we&#39;ve seen and that&#39;s it. What surprises me the most is that the phenomenon followed me at exactly the same distance all the way until I stopped in the yard at home. I don&#39;t remember when it was at all, but since all 3 children were at home and the eldest moved away when she turned 18 in 1978, it must have been before 1995.",

Yes, not only that, I have seen a big beautiful light, like a big star, light up and go out! More to come, we saw two reddish lights moving past each other on opposite sides of a star. We thought it was one satellite until we saw it was two and then suddenly saw them come together and disintegrate into 4 bright flashes. Yes, we have seen many fine things, and I hear of many others than us who are seeing things in the sky at present. All this is within a week.

My father comments that it is moving. When we notice it moving, we study it closely, it is a centered light source, glowing bright yellow, surrounded by a dense haze. The light source rotates around itself, at certain times it is completely turned away from us, then it is just an illuminated haze. The light source moves a few degrees around the night sky, no high speed, no sudden movements. There is not a cloud in the sky besides this haze. There was a full moon, so everything was very clear to us. The light source eventually disappears into the haze, and the haze dissolves, leaving no trace in the night sky. We have a 52 second recording of the light source. In this shot, it looks like it&#39;s a three-legged light source that is rotating around itself.",

That one afternoon in the summer of 1998 he should have seen 4 luminous objects swarming around one after the other at a fairly fast speed across the sky. He also claims that they gathered together in a lump the size of one of them, and then spread out again at high speed. He then stood and looked at it for approx. 2 minutes. He then rushed inside for his camera, but when he came back out, they were gone. He was very shocked the next few days, I remember. Just thought I&#39;d report it here :)",

It was completely cloudless and very starry with a very faint blue sky background between the stars, the black between the stars is not completely black. Observed a triangular object, a white light in each corner, a fainter white light between the three points, and 2 to 4 even fainter lights inside the triangle, with a broad side towards me and the tip farthest, looked up under it and the triangle was darker than the sky. Size of the object at first observation was like my thumb nail in outstretched arm, approx. 17 mm. wide and approx. 20 mm. long and 2 hand widths above the horizon without thumbs, approx. 170 mm. also at arm&#39;s length. The three brightest lights were slightly fainter than the nearest stars. The object slowly became smaller and the light dimmer, at approx. 23.12, the size was a little smaller than my little finger nail, which is approx. 9x13 mm. From approx. At 23.15 it became almost impossible to see the light directly, but could still see it in the peripheral vision, the edge of one&#39;s field of vision, and at approx. 23.20 it is almost completely gone and stopped the observation. The course itself, if extended in both directions, would be almost straight east to west with a course north of me. Hope there are others who have observed this, whatever it was, it is something I will never forget.",

We continue out of Sørupvejen, where we can still see several luminous circles in the sky. We reach Vetterslev, where we turn onto Næstvedvej, and at Susåen we see them again in the western sky. We turn onto Sandbyvej towards Glumsø and drive up to Sandby Kirke, where we could faintly glimpse them again. The view was too bad, and we turn and drive back to Sandbyvej. We drive a bit out there and can still see them flapping in the sky. We drive onto Timannsvej, where there is an unobstructed view of the north/west sky. We turn off the car and the lights and sit and watch these circles of light that zig zag in the sky. They stand completely still and disappear VERY quickly towards the north. We also looked with binoculars and could only see white light, but not what. If we see a star as 2 mm in diameter, then here they were 8 cm in diameter. They were moving at a speed that was absolutely extreme. And disappeared as quickly as they came. Don&#39;t know if it&#39;s an observation used, but we&#39;ve never seen or experienced anything like it.",

At 03.50 Sunday 22.11.2015 I wake up for an unknown reason (no sounds or bright light in my room) and see &quot;through&quot; my curtain something that I first assume are white balls shot up by a &quot;Roman candle&quot;. There is no sound and the balls do not &quot;fall&quot;. Within a few seconds, approx. 7-8 bright white glowing balls in a row-like design. Not in a straight line, but in a slightly uneven longitudinal row with a few pieces slightly to the side for this. At first I thought, as mentioned, that it was balls of light going upwards, but gradually it dawned on me that instead the row of balls was moving horizontally and very quickly from the west and over or slightly north of the block of houses I live in - still completely silent. The height is not great, perhaps within a few hundred meters. Since after approx. 5 seconds disappear &quot;across&quot; the house, I hesitate for a few seconds (5-6), after which I rush into my kitchen, whose window faces due east. There I see in the haze over Åbyhøj and Århus that the balls of light have continued further into the haze and after a further approx. 5 sec. I can no longer guess them. Regarding the weather there is clear to the west when the observation begins, the Moon is quite low and half free and half covered behind a small cloud. To the east, on the other hand, it was misty and cloudy - it must be the weather edge that was promised to bring snow in our area on Sunday morning (and it did).",

Slowly the three luminous objects disappear - perhaps because of the city lights - but the last one continues to an angle of between 80 and 90 degrees due south above the horizon, where it disappears - again probably because of the city lights. There was no sound in connection with the observation, and the objects did not appear to follow any fixed route/line in their movement. I called a friend and he had also observed the phenomena.",

My girlfriend is in Jutland (Fredericia) and can also see it. We both have video footage of it, but of course it&#39;s hard to see properly on video.

I call the police and then the air force and report the sighting and go to the roof to get a better overview. Here I see a similar object just to the south of the other, and they have now both held position for 2 hours and 38 minutes, and it appears that they are still holding their position while flashing bright colors. Over the course of the night, I have been keeping an eye on the migration of the stars across the starry sky, and these 2 objects have kept their exact position for the time being.

I pull into the first parking space and stop the car. There is no engine noise from the light objects, and no smoke trails behind them. They are neither helicopters, airplanes, nor any other type of motorized aircraft, and this evening it is completely windless. The 4 orange light objects are exactly the same size. They fly from west to east in a straight horizontal line, and with an equal distance between them. The speed is like the speed of a tourist plane. Within a few minutes, the light objects are out of sight again. The orange light from the objects is vivid/flashing, and looks like encased fire. The experience is beautiful and unique.",

Calling my wife, who is sitting on the couch, so she can verify what I&#39;m seeing. She sees the same thing as me. We follow the object until we can no longer see it behind the rooftops. Presumably it lasts 1-2 minutes. There is sunshine and blue skies, so others must have seen something related to this sighting. When I spot the object, it is coming from an eastern direction seen through the leaves on the trees. When it is freed from the leaves on the trees, it flies in a westerly direction and, as I said, disappears behind the roofs, since we live in the middle of the city. Our windows face south.",

I hastily grabbed my phone and filmed the bullet for approx. 10 minutes. Meanwhile, I saw other small dots flying towards the sphere. 2 dots, flew, slowly to the ball and disappeared when they were in the same position. After a while, the ball starts to shine in yellow colors, which I also got on film. I thought at the beginning of this that it was an optical illusion with the shiny ball, while my eyes started to get irritated. I also got the shiny steels on film. My hands started to get tired, so I went back inside. An hour later, when I had to smoke again, the bullet was gone.",

I suddenly caught sight of something really far away, almost gliding just as slowly towards the east above the treetops up by my parents&#39; house approx. 300 m to the south from where we were standing. I told my mate who saw it straight away. We hurried up to his room, which was on the 1st floor facing south and with an unobstructed view. We found binoculars and could clearly see what we called &quot;windows&quot; on something that was really long and fairly flat. The object moved slowly from west to east for approx. 10-15 minutes and almost slipped away from our field of vision. Many thoughts went through both of us, but this couldn&#39;t possibly be a Zeppelin, because purely in terms of size, there would be at least 2-3 Zeppelins that had to be put together, and why would it be flying around on a New Year&#39;s Eve over Holstebro? (Finally, I want to say that I have, of course, told about the experience to others, but never before today wrote to anyone about this New Year&#39;s Eve in 1978. The reasons why I am doing it so many years later is because I Today I am going to read the archives of the air force and to my great joy see that something inexplicable was seen precisely in Holstebro, Struer and Ans at the same time, the only thing I cannot remember for sure is the exact time of the evening, but would have said somewhere between 19:00 - 20:30.",

Was initially observed near Mars and disappeared slightly before and below the star Arcturus. So max. 15 degrees above the horizon. If you ignore the color, it looked like 2 planes, one below and behind the other. Very straight course. I figured it was a couple of military jets. but one lost speed, stopped, and died out. The other died out 10 seconds later, but did a small flare-up before disappearing completely. Observed in 7x50 binoculars without being able to see further details. Have seen ultralights same direction/height a few km below. Then later a flashing light (plane) for approx. same track. The weather was clear with a few clouds. Possibly space debris.",

Could be reminiscent of a projector from e.g. a lighthouse or aircraft which turns, aiming the projector&#39;s eye directly at one, and then &#39;disappears&#39;, but the object did not change direction. Nor did it remind me of a normal shooting star, as these usually just get fainter and fainter, and not suddenly light up strongly like here. Also, all previous shooting stars I&#39;ve seen move much faster and over a longer distance. Could perhaps be a satellite that rotates on its own axis and thereby reflects the sun in a flash. This could possibly explain that the object did not change direction. I&#39;m not that familiar with stars, but the closest beacon was a very clear star, which was right above us, here in Vangede in Gentofte. The object did not pass far past this star.",

It first moved a short distance to the west, then it stood still in the air for 3-6 seconds, then it flew to the north, again a short distance, where it stood still for approx. 1-3 seconds later it flew northwest, at extreme speed, behind some trees. We tried to follow it, but when we got behind the trees it had disappeared. The time between it reaching behind the trees and us reaching behind the trees was approx. 10 seconds. Behind the trees was a wide clear night sky, therefore it must have had an incredibly high speed to be able to disappear from sight so quickly. During the entire process, no machine noises or other suspicious noises were heard. In the aftermath, we went out into the city and overheard an upset little boy yelling at his mother about the fact that &quot;They&quot; actually exist. The connection between the boy&#39;s statement and the incident is of course pure speculation, but in that case an interesting case.",

It is blurred because they are seen as if behind a cloud or in fog, but it all rotates very slowly and at the same time also moves slowly forward. I continue walking as I can&#39;t see anything more because of the tree canopy and as we go further forward there is a cloudless sky and I can&#39;t see anything of what I had just seen.

        "content": "I can&#39;t remember the exact year, but it was at least in the mid-1980s. I myself was born in 1970. I was born and raised in Harlev J (just outside Aarhus), and it was here that I had an observation that, after all these years, I would now like to tell you about: I come walking along Grønhøjvej. I have to go over to Gammel Stillingvej, so I want to take the path that goes between the two parallel roads (between Grønhøjvej 36 and Gl. Stillingvej 409). Since the path was below road level, I go down a tiled staircase and just as I&#39;m about to go down, I see a flying object that looks nothing like anything I&#39;ve seen before. However, I have no doubt that I saw it. It looked like a helicopter and was about the same size and shape, or maybe rather the shape of a waterman or fireman when moving in the water, but with a flat bottom - kind of like an igloo. It had no propeller, and (of course) no wings either. It was transparent, ie. constructed of a glass-like material. Therefore, you could see into the object/cockpit. And here I saw two men. I know it sounds like I suffer from delusions and hallucinations, but I don&#39;t, and I never have (nor have I ever taken euphoric drugs). In the object, two men were sitting next to each other, but it was only one that I really noticed, namely the one sitting on the same side where I was. He was tall, slim and with long legs and was probably what we earthlings know as a 40-50 year old. I noticed that the one with the long legs had his hands placed on something that might be used to navigate. The object was close, maybe 50 meters up and was standing still in the air. When I saw it, I was extremely taken aback and a little scared because of the unexpectedness of the situation, and I clutched tightly at the railing connected to the stairs. I turned my head because (when I came walking) I had seen a woman called Anne Grethe. She stood and was stuffing something into the trunk of their car. I wanted to shout: &quot;Anne Grethe!&quot;, but I couldn&#39;t. Then I looked up at the sky again, but there the object had unfortunately disappeared. I resented (and still do) that I hadn&#39;t fixed my gaze on the object, because then I probably would have seen it when it moved away/disappeared. The object made no sound, but I have no doubt that I saw this object! I have only told a few people about the episode as I think, &quot;No one will believe it anyway.&quot; I told my first boyfriend, who I was with for 17 years. He was open to my explanation, but it has rarely been a topic of conversation between us. And then I&#39;ve told it to my current husband, who shakes his head if the conversation rarely turns to unidentifiable flying objects, and I tell what vision I&#39;ve had. In fact, I&#39;ve never had the urge to talk about it widely, because I&#39;m sure of what I saw, and I don&#39;t want to be in a situation where I have to convince people that it is true. That I know it myself, that is the most important thing for me. Because you probably think I&#39;m shrill crazy, I&#39;ll just briefly tell you a little about myself: I&#39;m 50 today, I&#39;m married and the mother of two, a 22-year-old boy and an 11-year-old daughter. ling.merc. in Spanish and bachelor in English and am used to dealing with rather difficult translations. Since my big dream is to be able to make a living from publishing fiction, I write novels, and I have so far published two novels in the field of social realism, one of which is in the genre of autofiction (ie something that happened to me in reality added to fiction) . None of these novels contain supernatural themes or outer space mysteries. And science fiction is not me at all. I am not a superstitious person - not at all. I&#39;m not interested in stars, astronomy, astrophysics or the like, but I think (like so many others) that the idea of life in space is exciting. Something I&#39;ve always wondered though is: If life exists elsewhere in the universe, why would it be hostile life? Why does almost everyone talk about us being taken over by strangers, possessed by something that is evil? If there is life out there, it could be that they are just curious about what it is like on earth and therefore have no evil intentions. Wouldn&#39;t we also be curious ourselves if the earthlings once got all the way out there to the universe, which we still have no knowledge of, and we became aware that there was life? So we wouldn&#39;t want to start a war right away, would we? We have gained a lot of knowledge about the moon, space, planets and much more in the last 50-100 years. How much faster will it go in the next 1000 years? Where are we in 3021? Our skills to reach even further into space will be so much greater, so it may be that by then we will have some kind of answer to what it was that I saw. Something I have wondered though is whether or not the life that might be out there is likely to be similar to us humans? What I saw looked like humans, only larger and with longer limbs. I hadn&#39;t imagined malformed, slimy creatures like in Aliens - but creatures that were more different from us. The reason why I suddenly decided to write to you now, over 30 years later, is that I happened to hear an episode of the knowledge and technology podcast series &quot;Flying saucer&quot; hosted by host Frederik Dirks Gottlieb on P1. Here, Luis Elizondo (former head of the secret UFO unit in the Pentagon) will, among other things, the interview regarding some videos published by the US government. It is therefore some high-ranking people with reference to the Minister of Defense who are open to the fact that there is something out there that we cannot dismiss out of hand. It is the broadcast that has made me think: &quot;Imagine now, if there is still someone who wants to believe me?&quot; It also gives me hope that you as an association and as &quot;ufologists&quot; will listen to my experience. IF it should happen that you have received other similar inquiries, it would be incredibly nice if you could give me information about or a link to where I can read about it. If you want more information from me, you are welcome to contact me. I think I am able to clarify many concrete things, but precise information about year and season etc. I can&#39;t quite remember. But the sight of the object itself and how I reacted is still very clear to me and I will never forget it.",

I could clearly see it moving/flying. It was oblong in shape, bright white, and the light seemed to be least intense in the center of the object. I first saw it under the Moon on the right, where it moved towards the left in a linear direction - after which it suddenly disappeared. Approx. 20 minutes later it was suddenly visible again, this time above the Moon on the right side and moving towards the left. It immediately seemed to be very high up. I would guess it to be &quot;4 millimeters&quot; in the sky, just seen with the naked eye. There were no blinkers on it like you normally see on an airplane and the speed I would think was slightly faster than an airplane. It also had no condensation trail behind it. I saw a plane somewhere else in the sky, and could immediately decide that they were in no way similar.",

We both looked out the living room window to the south and saw 2 red lights (alternating red/orange) hanging next to each other approx. 20 degrees above the star Sirius. (About as high above Sirius as Sirius above the horizon). I immediately spotted 2 more red lights further down (below Sirius). I took my prism binoculars and ran up to the bedroom, opened the slanted window and caught the red lights in the binoculars. They apparently hung still. There was absolutely no sound and it wasn&#39;t 4 airplanes. It could be balloons in calm weather. But it is not common for balloons to have lights on them. The 2 lower lights disappeared down behind some trees. The top 2 hung apparently stationary, but gradually I could see in relation to the surrounding stars that they were slowly moving away to the south or south-southeast. I had the last one in my sights approx. 10 min., until it finally also went down behind the trees. It had (like the others) a red light without extension and slightly flickering now and then into orange. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it and can&#39;t really imagine what it is.",

The hole gets bigger and bigger and becomes like an oval. The hole/light if you will - splits in two and suddenly looks like an open powder can, both still oval - the phenomenon stands like this for a bit and suddenly the top (lid) disappears, and slowly the other light (bottom) disappears into nothingness again, and the cloud is still there.

I was 21 at the time and lived in Gødvad near Silkeborg. My mother picked me up in her car (I didn&#39;t have a car myself), and we were going to Resenbro, where my mother lived at the time, which is also near Silkeborg. When we come towards the bridge at Resenbro kro (which still existed then), I say to mother, it&#39;s strange, no planes usually come over the stream, and so far down. At that time it flew. My mother said that it was probably the plane to Greenland (the one she always kept an eye on because my big brother had almost just left for Greenland), but then we looked again, and now it was standing still over the stream. It was approx. 2-3 meters above the water and approx. 100 meters away from the bridge. It was spherical and the size of a table globe, it shone in a white, very bright light. We stopped on the bridge and stopped the engine and got out of the car. At the same time, a car came from the opposite direction, they also stopped and switched off the car. They stayed in the car for approx. a ½ minute. We just stood and looked at it. When the other 2 got out of their car, it disappeared so quickly it cannot be described. It flew towards Gødvad and just above the treetops. There was no sound either when it was stationary or when it was flying. The others got back into the car and drove towards Gødvad. I wanted us to turn the car around and also drive to Gødvad again, but mother didn&#39;t want to, because as she said, it&#39;s over all the mountains now. So we drove home to mom. We would have liked to have talked to the other 2 in the other car, but they hurried away. We told my stepfather and my little brother. My little brother wanted us to drive to Gødvad, but mother didn&#39;t want to. So it continued that we had seen it across the stream. We have talked about it many times since the time we saw a UFO over the river. I was very fascinated by it. I have always believed that they exist, so this was a confirmation for me that they do. Neither mother nor I have had it publicly, but that&#39;s because we didn&#39;t know where to turn. It is an experience I will never forget. Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t seen any UFOs since.",

        "content": "My girlfriend and I were out walking the dogs on Tordenskjoldsgade by the skating area opposite the 10th class centre. We sit on the bench and let the dogs play, so they could be tired before we went home to bed. After sitting and talking for a bit, I see a shooting star and we start looking up at the night sky to see if we could see more as it was starry. We spot planes, satellites and see a few more individual rock shots, when suddenly I see something that resembles a satellite, only much bigger, and which moves approx. 4-6 times faster. I manage to point up in the sky and my girlfriend also sees this satellite-like thing. It was very clear and without twinkling, so a plane is out of the question, and neither was a shooting star, as I have seen many shooting stars in my lifetime. My girlfriend has also seen quite a few of these, then we stood there and both had never seen anything like it in the sky. It was round, but at the same time somewhat square, and it flew completely silently with a speed reminiscent of a fighter jet, maybe a little faster, but without blinking. Satellites tend to be fairly small and don&#39;t move that fast, so you can follow them for a very long time. So what have we been seeing? It came out of nowhere and flew across the sky from east to west to almost fly away, i.e. into space and disappeared. I have never seen anything that resembled or resembled my sighting, nor has my girlfriend ever experienced anything that could resemble what we saw....",

It was NOT a helicopter - the flying object had no rotor, nor did it emit engine noise or lights. We were rather puzzled and I got my binoculars to take a closer look at the object. The strangest thing was that it looked like there were some kind of pennants fluttering from the object. Some might think that it was a flock of birds - but that was definitely not the case. The object flew quite silently from NW to NE - almost straight over our house. My wife and I could not identify the object with anything we have seen or experienced so far. In the 2 following days, I thoroughly studied newspapers and the Internet to see if others should have observed the same phenomenon or if there could possibly be a reasonable explanation. But I have not been successful in my efforts. It was a very strange experience - I hope others have seen the phenomenon and can explain what it is we have seen.",

        "content": "I have long observed a twinkling star and decided to look at it a little. I saw it change color to blue and took out a pair of theater binoculars. It looked oblong (3-4 balls of light in a vertical row with red, green and white light moving along it. I then borrowed a bit better binoculars and saw both yesterday and the day before several stars that do not look like stars or planets , as they change shape and direction from horizontal to vertical and change color. They are not airplanes or hot air balloons as I have observed the one twinkling star over a long period of time and it seems to have a fixed position as it is roughly same spot in the sky every night from 19:30-23:00 approx From my view on the balcony but one of the others I observed yesterday moved and at first I thought it was a plane but when I took my binoculars I could clearly see it wasn&#39;t. Planes fly past here regularly too so know what they look like and they don&#39;t stay in the same position for hours either. I don&#39;t know who can help me figure out what it is, but will try here first, as I have googled multi-colored flashing object and found an answer from malte olsen, who is a physicist at the niels bohr institute, but his answer was not clarifying. I&#39;ve seen your observation chart but I&#39;m not sure how to explain the positions etc. I have a program on my iphone with planets etc. It is between mars and jupiter i.a.",

I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s kidding about that, so I went out and looked up, but since I live in the middle of the city 25 kilometers away from his location on the bus, I couldn&#39;t see the Moon. I then got up after my boyfriend at 11.35pm and we looked up all the way home and he explained to me that he had seen a bright object 10 times bigger than a star which flew in straight lines up and down around the Moon for 2 minutes . When we come up to a clearing between two houses, out of nowhere in the middle of the sky to the west an object appears that looks like a star, but 10 times bigger. It flies in a straight line to the south at a speed 5 times faster than a jet fighter. There is no sound, just a sharp flash as the object appears and disappears into the blue again. I screamed like a stung pig in the middle of the street in the clearing because I have never been more convinced that it was a UFO. Never seen such a large luminous object in the sky before, and never fly so fast and so straight. As I said, it came out of thin air and disappeared again into nothingness.",

So today it upsets me that I didn&#39;t dare to stand out and take off my glasses. I have astigmatism in both eyes and see if it was still there. I don&#39;t think so, because I think it&#39;s an optical phenomenon of some kind, which happens when you look through the double glazing of the windshield and even wear glasses with structural defects. It would be interesting if you could recreate it by experiment, because today I can show where I left off. The country road is unchanged.

How high it was up was difficult to estimate. It flew a bit wobbly/shaky and completely silent. I estimate the size to be, if you take a DKK 1 and hold out an outstretched arm, almost as big as the Moon. Because before that I observed several inexplicable flashes high in the sky to the west, which could remind me of a lot of lightning. My mother, who lives approx. 3 km further south, had seen the same flashes.",

Looked for a few seconds and then ran for binoculars/camera, but despite speed, the object was gone. It was totally cloudless, so it amazes me that it suddenly appeared in the night sky - as if a light was turned on. Tried to google an answer, but can&#39;t find any.

It looks most like the bottom of a car. There were square &quot;things&quot; like four wheels on a car, but they were out on the side of the UFO. When it started flying over us it was totally silent. It must have been very large because even though it was very high up in the air, we could clearly see the shape. It flew slowly over us and then it just flew away......

After looking at this for a while, I saw that the object changed direction vertically as well as horizontally almost moving like a square. The movements were fast and my assessment is that the object moved within a range of 50-100 meters, however without knowing how far away the object was. I picked up my parents, who subsequently witnessed the phenomenon. After approx. 10 min from the start where I had seen it, it started to change brightness. Alternating very bright to fading white light. This process continued for approx. 5 min., after which the object disappeared out of sight.",

We lifted our heads as we walked. So many stars. Immediately I see 3 &quot;stars&quot; (because the 3 lights were no bigger than a star in the sky) moving quite quickly across the sky to the south. Much faster than airplanes, but a little slower than &quot;shooting stars&quot;. The funny thing was that all 3 lights suddenly switched places on their route. They flew very fast, and then they had come too far on the horizon after the approx. 4 sec., we looked.",

        "content": "Three yellow glowing orbs appeared from west to east - descending towards the ground. I only made eye contact when they appeared in my window. At first I thought it was shooting stars, but it definitely wasn&#39;t. The 3 balls were next to each other, but they didn&#39;t stick together - they moved individually. They stopped approx. 50 meters up, they didn&#39;t seem very big. I took my camera outside to take pictures, but I was too shocked/enthralled by the sight to figure out how to turn off the flash, so the pictures haven&#39;t worked - one was just black, one was all white. There were no sounds/machine noise or any other kind of sound from the luminous balls at all, after approx. Half a minute in the same place, where they moved a little between each other, they flew slowly to the south. Approx. 10 minutes later they reappeared from exactly the same direction and took up the same position, approx. 50 meters above my neighbor&#39;s house. After again hanging in the same place, moving a little back and forth, they again flew south. Approx. 100 meters from my position, it looked like they dropped/threw something luminous towards the ground. After this, they again flew slowly to the south and disappeared quietly on the horizon. At no point could I sense any outline/shape on the glowing orbs - it was just 3 yellow glowing round orbs. It was a fantastic sight, I was really taken aback, as I quickly think that I could rule out that it could be something familiar (searchlight, fireball, helicopter, etc.) It really annoys me that I couldn&#39;t find out of operating my camera - hope you can shed light on it.",

Can&#39;t say how many degrees above the horizon, but high up, like a star. I saw the object move occasionally so it was NOT a star or planet. And it was definitely NOT a plane or a helicopter. The object stood still for some time occasionally, then moved again, not far, but enough to be seen. A couple of times it kind of dipped a little, but came back to the starting position. I went to bed but got up again at 23.15 to see if the item was still there. It was, but it had moved a very long way - compared to how far it had moved previously. It was exciting and incredible to watch. It cannot be ruled out that it could have been a UFO.",

It is visible for approx. 20 sec., and disappears a few times in the clouds. Therefore reasonably sure of the height of the object. Sure it wasn&#39;t a plane, meteor, satellite. The wind was probably southerly, but the object was not wind-borne at the speed. The object moves from south to north, along the Roskilde fjord. Have been a soldier, and have experienced attacks from fighter planes during exercises, and based on these experiences, I would think that the speed of the object is approx. 800 km per hour. Have previously experienced planes with yellow lights, but only seen oncoming ones. Never from the side. Distance from observation point to the object, I would guess between 2 to 3 km.",

Then went outside to see if I could see anything there, but it seemed to just stand still again, then went down to myself and looked out the window one more time, when suddenly something very strange comes with lots of light in the middle and red glow above and below. I rush outside again and go up the stairs and can follow it disappearing to the south at low altitude. The red light was all I could see before it sort of faded away. The way I saw it, it was not that far away, no more than 1 km, and there was no engine noise coming from it.

I saw it as if it was flying at an altitude of 300 meters at a little over 100km/h. Size approx. 5 meters long. Based on the drone I flew with, I had a good idea of the correlation between speed and size, but the height may well be completely wrong. One thing that amazes me is that it was completely silent. Right above me in a quiet place. The propeller from my own drone could be clearly heard and other propeller or jet aircraft could be heard many kilometers away. I thought it was a military drone of some kind, but I&#39;m still wondering.",

When I was standing there, I suddenly saw from the NE side of the sky 2 objects which looked like two bright stars moving at a very high speed. And as it seemed to me, they flew very low, approx. between 300 and a maximum of 1 km up. There was no sound from the two objects which flew west. I can tell the difference between meteorites, satellites and almost all kinds of lights on airplanes and the way they move or maneuver at night. I am SURE that what I saw last night was a UFO.",

I walked the dog and we chose the marketplace. At one point approx. in the middle of the square I notice a bright white light as from a plane in a north-westerly direction, moving south at a moderate speed. The dog and I take a break. And probably because of the bank of fog, I&#39;ve been keeping an eye on the &quot;plane&quot; when it suddenly stops and stands still for a minute or two and then the hell with it and takes off in the opposite direction - stops again. Stands still for several minutes and then takes a turn again at the same speed. This happens 2 maybe 3 more times. It actually moves around with the horizon, so when I lose visual contact with the object, it is in the opposite direction to when I discovered it. I have no idea what it was that I saw, but the speed was way too high for an airplane and the way it stopped, up, shouldn&#39;t be attributed to an airplane either.",

We were on my father&#39;s boss&#39;s field a little outside Nordby. We were supposed to shoot birds - crows I think, and I was therefore told that we went our separate ways around a small forest so that if one of them chased something up, the other could shoot on the other side of the small forest. After I have started walking one way and he the other, and have walked approx. 100 to 150 meters I get the feeling that there is something above me. When I look up, there hangs in the air &quot;I know&quot; a white light. It hangs completely over me. It was really hard to tell how far it was up, but it was the size of a car light at a little over 50 meters away. Confused, I stood and stared, probably mostly out of wonder, at this object for approx. 7 maybe 10 seconds. Enough to see it clearly and distinctly, my best description is a ball of light or rather a ball of chromed silver that threw all the light of the sun right at my head. As I said, it was almost cloudless, but after approx. 10 sec. a small cloud comes, almost the only one in the sky, and hovers right between me and the object and blocks my view, until it approx. 3 sec. after disappearing, is the object I had just been looking at for a few seconds. before, gone. It&#39;s really unbelievable, since I could look all around the little cloud, and believe me, I did. It really was as if it disappeared with the speed of light, and I think maybe I know it too, I looked at it... When we got home I said nothing, I didn&#39;t even know what I was thinking. Over time, however, it has become crystal clear to me, although I can only guess what the hell was inside it. Or what could hold it up. Since then, I have told a few people what I saw. Now, several years later, I have almost become addicted, I haven&#39;t seen the same since, but I follow all the media in newspapers, online and TV about the strange incidents people tell about . I am personally 100% sure we are not alone….",

        "content": "One summer morning, the weather was really good, I stood out on our east-facing terrace and looked in the north/east direction, the sky was completely clear and there was no wind at all. Suddenly I see something slowly flying from west to east. It is a relatively small object which corresponds very well to the description given in the article, it most resembled a flying refrigerator lying down, and it actually had some things sticking out at both ends. At first I think it&#39;s a balloon, but since there&#39;s no wind, it&#39;s moving too fast and far, far too steady to be anything like a balloon. It flew almost as if it were on rails, which a balloon doesn&#39;t do. Could it be a remote-controlled plane of some kind? No! Because there was no sound at all from it, and the hum that a remote-controlled engine makes can be heard far away. I think it was moving at 30-40 kilometers an hour and it flew right over some blocks of flats which are about 60 meters from our house so it was quite close to where I was standing and therefore I&#39;m quite sure what i saw matches my description. It has been up to a height equivalent to 10-20 meters above the roof ridge of the blocks, and the blocks are 4-storey standard blocks from the 60s. I follow the object and see that it is flying in the direction of the center of Køge, and here it is that I think that if it has continued on that course, approximately north/east, then it will end up in Copenhagen at some point. I have never forgotten what I saw, but I have also never seen the object again, however I do know that there have been people over in the blocks of flats that it flew over who have experienced a strong light beamed into their windows late in the evening, and those reports are about 10-12 years back in time, and I remember that there was a lot of talk about that/that light in the neighborhood that summer. About 10-12 years ago, I also saw some lights over Køge bay, for which I also have no explanation. I stand one evening at 9-10pm outside our front door, which faces south. It is completely starry, and it has also been during the summer period. I look at the stars and see one of them start to move slowly to the north/east, it could easily be a satellite, I think, but a few seconds later, another star starts to follow the first, and then my serious attention. And believe it or not, a few seconds after the first 2 start moving, they were completely still to start with, then first a 3 and then a 4 start moving after the first in the same direction, and there are now 4 stars flying in a straight line one after the other to the north/east. It should be said that our house is right under an approach route to the airport, so I see a lot of different planes every day and night all year round, but these 4 objects simply could not have been planes or helicopters and certainly not those Chinese hot air bags, it has become so popular to send up. I have not seen anything like it since then, and therefore I remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday.",

We saw that it was closed and then heard some voices inside a garden approx. 10 meters from us. We heard them talking about how you couldn&#39;t fly a parachute when it was dark, so it was just a pure reflex that we both looked up into the air and saw the reasonably bright light standing completely still in the air. We heard no sound or wind, only the large object, which was shaped like a bus, it was about the same size. It didn&#39;t take more than a few seconds before it started drifting south west, it looked like it was rocking back and forth, but it drifted far away until we couldn&#39;t see it anymore. My companion and I were very sure that such a plane does not exist in Denmark. I also knew that if it was a plane or a helicopter, which I&#39;m 100% sure it wasn&#39;t, my dad is an aircraft mechanic and knows a lot about planes. We went and wondered what it was. Half an hour later we were on our way home and were talking about what it was, especially the strange red and white light that looked like a big searchlight. After we had reached a road called Amalievej, I turned to see if it should have come again. High up in the sky we then spot the very bright light and then decide to sit down and keep an eye on it. It took approx. 2-3 minutes, and it disappeared into the sky. It became so small that we could no longer see it. I have talked to my father a lot about what it could have been, and he then thought that it could have been a small hot air balloon that had just drifted far away and came back with another air stream. But it can&#39;t be, because we saw it, it was black, and we saw nothing but a black bus thing.",

In any case, I lose sight of it behind me, and only after approx. 5 minutes is it possible for me to stick to the side. I am now just outside Ry. I get out of the car and scan the entire horizon to spot it again, but despite it being bright sunshine and completely cloudless, I can&#39;t spot it. I then proceed to my destination in Ry, where I arrive a few minutes later. Here I catch sight of it again, and now, as I myself stand still, I can ascertain that it is moving in a north-westerly direction, where I follow it until it is out of sight. The vessel was in approx. 1 km. altitude, I will shoot at (it was clearly lower than some of the other planes I saw that day anyway). The shape of the vessel itself was oval, and without visible wings or anything. In terms of color I would think it has been glossy as you could see the sun reflecting in it. No sounds could be heard, nor was there any white streak left behind, as is usually the case after ordinary planes. It all happens between 13.45-14.00.",

But it does not move in a straight line like a satellite or plane, but a little &quot;wobbly&quot;. Then I stop and follow it approx. 1 minute. It is up above the cloud cover, which has large clear holes through which you can see the dark sky and a few stars.

My observation was 2 very bright red orbs moving in a non-uniform trajectory up and down just above the horizon. Since it was daytime, I was amazed at the brightness they had. The 2 luminous objects have been at a distance of approx. 10 km from my observation point. The movement patterns of the objects, which were incredibly erratic as they both went up and down and around each other, ruled out most types of aircraft and emergency rockets!!. The magnification of the binoculars I used to start with was 7X. But it was not enough to see what was behind the luminous objects. Therefore, I quickly picked up my telescope with a magnification of 150X. With this I could see a metal like figure behind the red glow. When I briefly (3 sec) changed an eyepiece to be able to better distinguish details, the objects completely disappeared from the otherwise wide horizon I had apart from the Slagelse area. I know that the day after this experience UFO sightings were reported in West Zealand. Unfortunately I don&#39;t know more. To this day, I am still very much amazed, because over the last many years, as a keen amateur astronomer and not since, I have experienced nothing like it.",

However, one could clearly see five-six vertical rows of about 15-20 constant white lights with a slight bluish tinge. Four flashing red. What we noticed was that the whole trip from right to left, i.e. from NW to SE, it was low-flying, slowly flying, and without a sound at any time. I said to the other two &quot;see a very low-flying plane&quot;, to which our friend bluntly replied &quot;that&#39;s not a plane at all&quot;.

        "content": "I just read in the news about a drop on a lens that was sent in as a UFO and that you have many explanations for natural phenomena. I saw something when I was a kid approx. 6-7 years old. for which I always wanted an explanation, if you can give it, I would very much like to hear about it. In approx. In 1992, my father built a summer house in Fjellerup. We lived every weekend in a caravan on the plot while my father built. One morning approx. at 8 we eat breakfast, my mother, me and my sister. My father had started work early. He calls us all out to see something strange. We have a sea view. Out at sea, there is quite clearly a powerful orange ball. Approx. same color as red-hot metal. It is quite large because we can see a fishing boat further out and it looks very small. The ball stands still for approx. 1 min and hovers just above the water. Suddenly it starts slowly going from side to side, the distance is huge every time it goes from side to side. The speed increases and the distance it moves with becomes greater and greater, the speed clearly becomes faster and faster You probably think of some light that reflects, but it wasn&#39;t, you could see the ball a bit like 3D. There were very few people there in 92. It was there physically, like a bullet. Don&#39;t know what it was, have thought about it a lot since, have you guys heard of anything like this before and is there any explanation as to what it could be?",

It&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve and we&#39;re out to see the fireworks. We stand and look around, and spot something that is NOT fireworks, a bright orange spot of light without flashing like an airplane, approx. 4 times larger than a powerful star, seen in the east with a steady course to the west. After approx. 20-30 sec. heading west, the ball of light turns off, heading south slightly rising. It gets smaller and disappears in the sky after some time. Sound?? not known due to background noise. I think that the ball of light had a height of 2,000-3,000 meters at first OBS. Speed 200-400 km/h, distance approx. 5,000-10,000 m.",

        "content": "I had set up my Gopro Hero 4 camera in the garden to photograph the Lyrid meteor shower. The camera was set to Nightlapse with a shutter speed of 30 seconds, and continuous recording. Shooting stars, of which I only got 3 shots, only appear in one image, as they don&#39;t last more than the 30 sec. shutter speed. Airplanes like to appear in multiple images, as long streaks that start in one image exactly where it ended in the previous one. I have been photographing the rotation of the stars in this way for the past six months and have never observed anything that could not be immediately explained. But in these pictures there is an object that moves across the sky and flashes approx. every 15 sec. In the pictures, it appears as two short lines of light on a line. It also looks like the flash is not momentary, but flashes up and down again, as the line of light is thin at the ends and thick in the middle. I have emailed the photos to Ole Henningsen, and can also email photos of shooting stars and planes from the same series, if there is an interest in comparing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a real UFO sighting myself, but since I myself can&#39;t figure out what behaves like that in the sky, you are the only ones I can think of to ask.",

I look at the really nice so-called &quot;good weather clouds&quot; when I spot what I first think is a seabird at a very high altitude, and tell my companions to look up. They do, and it is at the height of the clouds, because it passes through one right at that moment. But soon we discover that it is not a bird, as it does not &quot;flutter its wings&quot;. Its shape is almost like a small, elongated &quot;stump&quot;, bright white. It continues noisily at good speed to pass over our heads, still at a great height. Since it is directly above us, the sunlight is reflected in it, or else it lights up from within; then write it back to the first luminosity and we discuss what it might be and can both rule out airplanes, gliders, balloons, satellites and kites. The object continues its course to the southwest and, just as it came into view, disappears into a distant cloud. During the incident we were sorry that we did not have binoculars with us, as we might then have been able to write off the sighting as an Unidentified Flying Object. But until we find out what it was, well, it was a UFO.",

I really wanted to get up and see what it was, but as soon as I lift my head from the pillow the sound disappears very suddenly. When my boyfriend wakes up to go to work, I ask him if he saw the light too, and he very definitely replied YES, and that he had no idea what it was, but that it was very strange.

The clouds must be at a height of 300 meters, and planes don&#39;t go down that far. The ball of light comes floating slowly from west to east. Guess it must be an emergency rocket. But it stops for a moment to disappear at a slightly higher speed towards the north. I follow it with my eyes, but it quickly fades in and is gone.",

Suddenly, while I&#39;m talking to my stepfather, some light above his head catches my vision, and I see something very strange for a split second. 2 streaks of light that approach each other in an identical arc from each side, and where they meet, shoot vertically into the air. The arches both had 2 colors, red and green in separate formation as seen in a rainbow, which this was not, however, since the brightness was intense enough to catch my eye, and since the sun was not out, at 23:30 approx. Next I thought of laser light, but that didn&#39;t seem to explain what I was seeing either. I have spent the last day waiting anxiously to see if there might be a similar observation on your website, but without success, after which I will now ask for your immediate offer. I was the only one who saw it as it only lasted a second and I was the only one sitting facing north/northwest where this happened. Neither did fireworks, which the colors reminded me of most of all, match what I saw, both because it seemed too symmetrical, almost like a triangle with soft long sides and no top, and it also shouldn&#39;t be able to change its path so drastically and vertically up into the night sky . Will greatly appreciate receiving your offer for an explanation, and contact you finally if you want the details elaborated.",

They were all glowing triangles and flew in different directions except for the first one I saw which went silent. I quickly called my boyfriend, but he didn&#39;t believe me... After several minutes of knocking on my neighbor&#39;s door, she came out with red eyes as if she was sick, and I asked her if she had seen the strange triangles outside in the sky. She said I&#39;ll have a look, but closed the door, so I don&#39;t know yet if she saw the glowing triangles. I went back to my balcony and the triangles slowly disappeared, one became completely transparent, the other flew up towards the room and two others flew together towards the water and the others did not see. After a few minutes, several different airplanes flew over Østerbro, maybe a helicopter, because I could hear the sound. I was completely confused and began to doubt what I saw, as I myself thought it was a very very strange experience and because my girlfriend did not believe me. But I know what I saw.",

It&#39;s a bit hard to judge the size as we don&#39;t know how far away it actually was, but would shoot at about the size of a medium sized airplane.

I have the choice to run in after someone, as I am alone and of course without a mobile phone. Typical. But I chose to follow it, because it changed direction behind the houses heading upwards towards the sky over Helgenæsvej, and up into the sky to become something flying that flashed red behind. Unfortunately couldn&#39;t see what it became, as it was too far away heading towards Præstø/Næstved Centrum right there in between. My brother thinks it&#39;s ball lightning I&#39;ve seen, but it wasn&#39;t bad weather, actually frosty, and it wasn&#39;t fireworks, I also ruled that out when I saw it, which was otherwise a fascinating sight, and I&#39;ll remember it as long as I live and am grateful that I got to see it.",

But at that time I could only see one... Needless to say my son stood on his balcony to wave goodbye to me. I stopped and waited a moment, then came over the roof and just after the first object an equally beautiful luminous UFO. I told him to get his camera, which was out front. However, my son still saw the 6 flying in formation, 1 in front, 4 in the middle and 1 coming as a rear stopper.. It was all over quickly, because they seemed to disintegrate or fly behind some clouds.. No sound or flashing lights..... My son got a picture of one of them... Since I&#39;ve gone approx. 5 min and I&#39;m about to get home, another beautiful object comes from the south, which, however, flies directly to the north, but disappears behind some clouds...

Upon closer observation, it could be determined that the sound and object were not connected. I saw to the north in the direction of Roskilde Cathedral, a fireball-like object coming from the east and moving west at a speed faster than an airplane. To follow the object, I ran into the living room to see it from my northwest facing window. The object disappeared behind the houses on the other side of the street. Then I went out onto the balcony again, and then another fireball, similar to the first, came across the sky in the same direction. It was as if you could sense a disk rising up behind the light/fire.",

Moving from north to south and at a speed roughly equivalent to an airplane during landing and at constant altitude in a very straight trajectory. Looked like it was only approx. 1 km up and approx. 5 km away from me (Safe optical illusion). The size was approx. to a single crown held out in outstretched arm. Didn&#39;t disappear into the horizon, but disappeared from the sky suddenly after it got far away from me. Could watch it for approx. 4 minutes. I spend a lot of time looking at the night sky and almost every time I see flying satellites high up and know very well that they can shine a lot and disappear suddenly when the sun no longer shines on them, but I have never seen this before, and as I said so it seemed to be close. Many must have seen it, because it shone brightly on the starry night. It was DEFINITELY NOT an airplane. It must surely also be visible from Kastrup airport, as it was approx. in the direction it eventually disappeared. Hoping very much for an explanation.",

He says: Hm, strange how bright it shines in a &quot;day&quot; sky. He sits on the sofa and looks at it and then says: but - so it moves a bit fast from a star of being, I think it&#39;s a plane. A plane I say - it has had the same direction and altitude for the ten minutes I have seen it. And then I go out and film it to see if it moves. And later I take a few photos after it has moved a distance of approx. 20 minutes. Is it a planet? Doesn&#39;t it seem to move like an airplane should?",

At first I was convinced it was the North Star, but when I located the Chariot it dawned on me that this was not a possibility. The size of the &quot;thing stone&quot; was slightly larger than the other stars (about 3-4 times larger than the average stars), I would actually say that it was a bit monstrous compared to the other bright objects in the sky. The shape of the unknown &quot;thingest&quot; was oblong, and from the object two rays shone from the sides - whereas the other stars were more circular, and their light under the star was a circular arc, and not two rays. The color that the &quot;thing stone&quot; had was dark, clear, luminous and curry yellow. The &quot;thing stone&quot; moved in an oval path that took approx. 5-6 min. I observed the &quot;thingesten&quot; at 2 am and stayed awake for approx. an hour, i.e. until 03, but the &quot;stone&quot; was still visible. When I got up at 4.30, the &quot;rock&quot; had disappeared from the sky.",

I do that often, as I often see the planes come in for landing at the airport. After approx. 30 seconds the bright white light got weaker but still pulsing/flashing, nothing obnoxious about it either. I&#39;ve seen hundreds of planes coming in, so I assumed that was the case here as well. Usually when I see this I can also see a movement in the direction of the plane. However, what caught my attention was that this seemed stationary. It hung in the same spot for some time, dimly glowing/pulsating. After two to three minutes it started moving at a very slow pace towards the east and in the same trajectory the whole time. It was thus not a question of a plane that was coming in for landing. I know the routine by now and this was, the more I think about it, quite unusual. It could of course have been a plane, but I doubt it. Just wanted to share this in case there are others who have seen the same thing.",

        "content": "Was out on the terrace on Saturday night smoking with my father-in-law - an architect, a man of few words and an old sailor. He has seen everything and believes in nothing. Just before we go in, my eye is caught by something moving - quite far down, maybe 40 degrees above the horizon. Four-six dots of light in a kind of formation. Looks exactly like a constellation that has &quot;torn loose&quot;. The formation races off above us and is gone in seconds, maybe even less than the five seconds. I point and shout &quot;look, look!&quot;. Father-in-law looks up and just manages to see them before they disappear above us, behind the roof. Apparent speed only slightly slower than meteors. If they were birds, they must have been very few meters away. About the size of the bar in the Chariot and surprisingly unchanging compared to the large bow I managed to see them. There was absolutely no sound and the light intensity was the same all the time, like stars. No stretch, just dots. Even I thought the strangest thing was the way they slid. It is difficult to describe. The flight did not look like anything organic at all - supernaturally fast, more &quot;sucked&quot; than pushed, not at all a known way of flying. Father-in-law knows all about birds and celestial phenomena, but has never seen anything like this.",

At first I think it is a soap bubble or feather, but with the constant fast speed of the object and the direct direction to the northwest, it is not likely, however, I have a hard time judging how far away the object is. If it&#39;s a soap bubble, it must be close, and I want to get my binoculars, but see that I can&#39;t reach it, and immediately afterwards the object disappears. It has been in the sky for approx. 10 seconds, and probably 5 seconds pass when it appears again, but this time the object zigzags like a butterfly, although still with a direction to the northwest, after 5 seconds it then disappears into thin air.",

The stars are incredibly bright and I am amazed at how many are visible this evening. After standing and looking at the sky for approx. 3-4 minutes, 3 red/orange lights catch my eye. Due to the light of the stars as &quot;background light&quot;, I manage to see that the 3 lights form a triangle. I can sense that there is a dark, solid &quot;body&quot; that forms an isosceles triangle. It is the &quot;tip&quot; that flies forward, meaning that it is the short side of the triangle that is the rear end. The 3 candles sat on the points of the triangle. The speed was neither slow nor fast, but I could follow it with my eyes for 10-15 seconds. However, I was left with the feeling that it was &quot;floating&quot; above the sky, which is the word that best describes it. It was completely silent, I heard nothing that could be described as engine noise. Since I live out in the country, there are no sounds that could &quot;blur&quot; my hearing. I also had the feeling that it was flying relatively low, that is, it was not particularly high up in the atmosphere. I followed it with my eyes until it disappeared to the west. I&#39;ve honestly never seen anything like it before! I felt like I was witnessing something completely unreal. I even whistled for it? For my brain imagined for a moment that it must be a very strange bird. And it always helps to whistle for strange birds... But must have known that thing in the sky was not quite normal.",

At first glance we just thought it was a plane, but suddenly another one came with the same light, speed, direction and height. This continued and we observed about 20 red lights passing silently across the sky. Glowing disappeared as they got far enough away. We are both curious about what it could be, but haven&#39;t found anything on the web about the same sighting, so I&#39;m writing here to hear if there is anyone who might. could explain these lights.

At 23.11 we stand looking at the full moon, and in addition we see Saturn a little to the west at the same height just to the south, and further to the west Mars stands fine. It is cloudless and very bright because of the moon, and there is almost nothing else to see in the sky, except for something that looks like a star a little east of Saturn. It stands still, so we perceive it as a star that appears approx. half the size of Saturn, but suddenly it moves to the east, but at the same time becomes weaker, and then stops long before it reaches the Moon. Then it becomes clear again and rises at a steady speed towards the NW up above Saturn, until it is perhaps 10 degrees above, where it stops and disappears, that is, the light disappears. Then we saw no more of the object. We are quite speechless by what we have seen. None of us have an explanation for what it was. I am an amateur ornithologist myself, and have been all my life. I am also interested in the starry sky and have been looking at constellations and galaxies for several years. I wear glasses, but my vision is ok, and the people I was with have fine vision.

Then at the same time one more, it behaved the same way, flashing, but also faintly visible between the flashes, moving across the sky faster than a (router) plane. Spotted at least 4, maybe 5 simultaneously moving, flashing and shifting objects in various places in the sky, 2 of them at one point moving close past each other. There were several twinkling &quot;stars&quot; that did not move, but all other stars were visible as usual. It wasn&#39;t shooting stars, could follow the objects for many minutes. So none of them directly disappeared, but they could be gone if I looked in the opposite direction for another, then looked back - and it was gone. Curious if others have observed the same or if there is a completely natural explanation.",

It shone down on the field with a &quot;pillar&quot; of light.

At first I wonder if I have caught something in my eye, as the light flows out and has color changes at the edge. I look at it and think, it&#39;s probably just an airplane that has the landing projector on, but I think that the colors in the edges and the large diameter of the lights don&#39;t remind me of an airplane&#39;s projector. So I follow it and think, when it has passed me, there must necessarily be a change in the intensity of the light if it is a plane. But there was no change at all, 1 minute after it passed, a &quot;real&quot; plane came flying almost diametrically opposite the object. And I thought, that plane is probably flying low, but it also fits very well with the fact that if it could be seen on a flight operator&#39;s radar, he must have told it to fly low. After the real plane had passed, I followed the object with my eyes, which by this time was a tiny dot in the sky, and it most resembled a star that stood all alone, as there were no other stars directly on it. that section of heaven. In the middle of all this, I came across a man who had stopped his car and got out. Thinking that this was a very strange experience, I asked him if he had seen it too. To that he replied yes. He didn&#39;t know Danish. He said something about having experienced the exact same thing two years back in a forest. He turned right off Hulgårdsvej, possibly to try to follow the light a little further. And I turned my nose towards home.",

        "content": "I&#39;m standing in the parking lot outside my car and I&#39;m about to lock it. I look up at the sky in a western direction when I spot some light moving in the sky. It flies in an easterly direction towards the place where I stand. Suddenly I think - what on earth is that coming flying there. It comes flying at a height of maybe 200-300 meters and is enormously long, I would say over 100 meters. It&#39;s loud. I can&#39;t say the speed exactly, but it flies reasonably fast. The whole session takes about 5 seconds, after which it disappears behind the roof of a building. But the view is incredible. I will try to describe it. As I said, it flies at a height of 200-300 meters. It is very long, reportedly over 100 meters and is tall and at the same time a bit slender. It is cigar-shaped, however, with a nice rounding both at the front and at the back. It passes almost directly over the place where I am, however, slightly offset to the north, so that I can see the entire right side of it. Approx. 1/3 from the front on the right side there is a large window and approx. 1/3 from the rear there is a correspondingly large window. Light comes out of these two windows. There are only these two windows on the page. I can also see light shining out symmetrically to the opposite side, i.e. its left side, but I could not see windows there. I wonder that the light I could see from the windows seemed hazy and a bit dull. The color was slightly yellowish. The weather was very clear with a starry sky and moon. The object itself was very clear, but the light from the windows seemed somewhat hazy. There was no light anywhere else on the object to be seen other than the mentioned windows on the right side and symmetrical light on the opposite side. There was also nothing that flashed. There was no sound from the object in the form of engine noise, nor was there any sound of drag or other indications of noise or commotion. The object had no wings. This was what I saw. I could feel a growing sense of insecurity, so I went back into the factory where I worked. The clock on the wall showed 04.07 and the clock runs correctly (matches the radio). Therefore, the exact time for the observation is 04.05-04.06. I jotted down various details on paper, in addition to trying to draw the object as I saw it. Later in the morning (at 10 o&#39;clock) I contact the Ringsted police to find out if they should have received reports of a flying object over eastern Ringsted at the time in question, but they had not. I can&#39;t be the only one who has seen this. Hope others have seen something that can confirm it. I myself know 100% that I have seen it. Unfortunately, I have no witnesses, photos or any other documentation for the above. Finally. Why have I chosen to rewrite and email this post? At first I was also against doing it, but curiosity and the hope that others besides me might have also seen something made me do it. I would also like to hear from you (SUFOI) if you have received this email and also from other people who may have on the night in question (18th March 2003 around 4am) seen something about this I have described. And at the very end, I would like to say that this feature is not fantasy, but really something I have seen with my own eyes.",

Then we looked out of the south-facing window and saw a large red ball moving quietly from west to east. The diameter of the sphere was between 10 and 15 m. Height above ground was slightly more than its diameter. When we could no longer see it from the living room, I ran out of the house and down the road so that I was directly behind its direction. Then I could see that the hemispheres, as on the left circle, moved after each other, did so in a track next to each other. There was no sound from the ball, no beams of light. When it had gradually become quite small, I went back to the house, and approx. ½ - ¾ quarter of an hour later, the boy said: &quot;There it is again&quot;. This time the movement was a mirror of the first time.",

        "content": "Last night, out of our kitchen window, I observed an object at &quot;star height&quot; emitting red, white and blue lights in &quot;flashes&quot;. Thought it was a plane at first, but it barely moved. It caught my attention, so I stood in the window. Then, for the next hour, I could follow it moving more and more to the south - approx. same line in the horizon. All else being equal, I would have thought it was a satellite (except for the light changes), but sometimes the &quot;object&quot; also moved up and down. A bit like a (slow) bee buzzing around something - i.e. the movement pattern. My husband watched it briefly but went to bed - a little shaken. My in-laws live in the house next to ours and I could see they were still up so I called them. They went to the window and then looked out into the garden. I went over to them and they admitted that it looked very strange. And I have some pretty down-to-earth in-laws. Since it was taking so long, I felt I had to contact someone. The best thing I could think of was to contact the police - not 112, but 114. I actually got to speak to a quite friendly police officer who did not - as you might expect - write me off as a Christmas brat or mentally ill. He said he would then stick his head out the window. Whether he just shook his head afterwards, I don&#39;t know. When it was a quarter past twelve I decided to go to bed. Last night at two o&#39;clock my one son had to go to the bathroom and I went out to see if &quot;it&quot; was still there. It wasn&#39;t, but by then some fog might have started to come. It was gone. By way of background information, I would just like to say that last night the weather was unusually clear and almost no clouds. I should just add to this story in closing that I am quite shaken by this experience which goes against everything I normally hold to. I have never believed in aliens, the supernatural or karma/fate for that matter. There is probably a pretty good explanation for this, but what it could be is beyond my comprehension. I spoke to a close colleague about the incident this morning and he believed there was an org. like yours - and we found this website on the web. Now I have reported what I saw.",

        "content": "I have followed a lot of various programs as well as had a website about so-called &quot;Unknown objects&quot; including unknown military aircraft types, including I have dealt a lot with the popular &quot;Area51&quot; also known as &quot;Dreamland&quot; in the large Groom Lake facility. Here I have heard a lot about research into a new propulsion system for aircraft. I saw on television pictures of an &quot;airplane trail&quot; that they believed was formed by this new propulsion system. I mean what I saw was VERY close to that. I walk home from work and look at the sky, I see a very strange trail of a plane. It starts very thin and then gets thicker and thicker. As it has become as thick as a normal airplane trail, the trail suddenly disappears into a nice gap, after which it reappears. The special thing is now, however, that small &quot;notches&quot; come out of the track, i.e. a straight flight track with small &quot;bumps&quot; from one side. The track continues like this for quite a while, after which it disappears completely. I wondered if it might be a gust of wind or something that had caused this strange formation, but I don&#39;t see how that could be possible. I have taken 2 pictures of the phenomenon, one of the place where the track stops and starts again, and 1 where you can see the small boils coming out of the flight track. However, the boils are not nearly as clear as they were when I first saw them, when I was on my way home from work and didn&#39;t manage to take the picture until the wind had taken hold of it a bit. What I might be interested in hearing were &quot;log books&quot; from the observation stations located in the area. The track came from the north, so it must have been across Tirstrup airport. Here, for example, you could find out if a plane has had engine problems and has stopped and started the engines in flight, or the like.",

It looks like a star that seems to jump from one side to appear a little further on and then back again. It does that sometimes, and then it&#39;s gone again. I didn&#39;t commit to it at the time, but several years later I hear about UFOs and have thought since then that maybe I should tell about it.

My attention is caught by movement (from the area behind my acquaintance, i.e. in a northerly direction), and I see what I first think is a plane from Billund. The plane (referred to from here on as plane, as I am skeptical and distrustful of these observations) passes under the cloud cover, over my acquaintance and me. My acquaintance sits with his back to the plane, so I am the only one who notices it. At first I think that it is a low-flying plane from Billund, but when it passes very quickly and completely and completely silently, I am very surprised (the plane also has a strong silhouette against the illuminated clouds above it, so I had no doubt , that it was very low-flying).

I decided to study the sky a bit. We have a good view to the southwest and northeast. It actually looked like a triangle standing on its tip. Then the 2 BRIGHTLY luminous objects began to move vertically into the air. They followed each other with exactly the same distance between them, all the way up, while the light in both grew dimmer and dimmer. It went very slowly. Then they were gone. I was all over the floor and went in to get some paper to draw on and I also looked at the clock. I hope there are others who have seen the objects, because it was an incredibly beautiful sight.",

        "content": "My inquiry concerns a UFO experience.. however some time ago. It&#39;s funny how people think a UFO is almost always round/oval. The experience of a UFO that I saw many years ago is nowhere near similar to anything around. Unfortunately I have no pictures, but fortunately a witness, so I know. that I&#39;m not completely crazy ;). Unfortunately, I have to guess a bit ahead of the year. But would think we are around the late 80&#39;s. There I was, a teenage boy (from 1974) and one late summer evening I was cycling on a path on my way home. We are in a town south of Aarhus (8355 Solbjerg). It is not dark yet and the weather is mild and there are no people anywhere. Just me and my bike. The trail I ride isn&#39;t crazy long, but that day it seemed extra long. On the right side of the path there are a lot of tall trees of various grand and pine trees, and on the opposite side there is a soccer field and some institutions. The road my home is on is just like parallel to the path on the opposite side of all the trees. Well, I come by bike, and for some reason while I&#39;m riding I look up at the sky. And there, just above me is an elongated moving cloud-like object (I have no idea how far up the object was.. maybe half a kilometer.. maybe more). I can feel myself shuddering and getting a little scared, so of course I cycle faster and see that the cloud seems to be following me along the path. When I reach the end of the path and have to turn right onto the road, the cloud speeds up further ahead of me, and I quickly cycle the 30 meters towards the road I live on. When I turn, the cloud just turns with me. Yes, it is actually true, although it sounds like a good story. And when I turn right again into the road where I live, I finally see another person at the end of the road (Parkvangen). The cloud is then above me, just as it has followed me. I cycle as hard as I can and look up and the cloud just got faster. I actually cycle past my home and down towards bystanders and shout &quot;look up at the sky&quot;.. or whatever I have said. The cloud &quot;gasses up&quot; and disappears over the field at the end of the road. The woman, who fortunately managed to see the object, still lives on the opposite side of where my parents live. So every time I see her, I have to check to see if we still have the shared experience together. And she confirms that it is true. That was my story. Don&#39;t know why I haven&#39;t told about it before. But now it&#39;s done and wondering if there are others who might have experienced the same thing. Because it will probably be a bit difficult to explain away my experience with a raindrop on my retina or something else;).",

        "content": "It was cloudy and close to dark, and a few stars could be seen in the sky. I looked out the dormer window from my living room and saw a dot of light in the sky that almost looked like a firework rocket heading for the top to explode. I didn&#39;t think much of it at first, as it is now normal at this time of year for people to start trying out their fireworks, and it often happens in that direction for approx. same height (10 degrees above the horizon) and light intensity. I looked anyway because I was waiting for the explosion. However, it did not explode after approx. 5 seconds of observation and, strangely enough, was left hanging for approx. in the same place in the sky. When I looked closer, the object had what looked like flashing traffic lights, so I thought it was an airplane that had come down a long way, but it didn&#39;t really move out of place like an airplane does. The object appeared to be about 0.5 km away, based on the brightness of typical air traffic lights. My curiosity was really piqued when I discovered that it danced restlessly and randomly around the place in a way that neither a plane nor a helicopter can do. I could see it moving because I was looking through the branches of our leafless birch tree in the garden. It was still bright enough to distinguish the branches from the sky. I opened the window to see it more clearly and observed the movements for about half a minute. The movements were approx. a finger&#39;s width wide, as when you hold your index finger out in an outstretched arm. It was cloudy in the area where the object was located. I ran downstairs and called my mother and I then ran down the driveway to study the object which I estimate was probably between 0.5 and 1 km away and still approx. 10 degrees above the horizon. We both observed the object for a few minutes and saw several of the unusual movements. We both agreed that it was no ordinary aviator. The object flashed in a rhythm of 4 or 5 flashes alternating between red and white lights placed in a diamond shape at each of its 4 corners and an additional light in the center. The flashes were symmetrical and each cycle lasted about 2 seconds. It still looked like a traffic light, but seemed a bit more &quot;advanced&quot; and a bit more powerful. I then ran in for binoculars and in after my father. When I came back out, the object had weakened and was descending behind the trees to the south. Through the binoculars I couldn&#39;t really see any more detail than when I first saw it and it was too dark for me to see a shape. I guess it was now between 2 and 5 km away. Unfortunately my father could not see anything and the object was now approx. as faint as a star. My father and mother then went inside again. I then went further up the road to the south-east to get clear of the trees, so that I could have a view of a field between two farms down to approx. 2 degrees above the horizon. The object was now so far away that I could only catch a few glimpses through the binoculars. I looked around regularly to check if there might be more objects in other directions, but there were none. After approx. 3-4 minutes I caught a few glimpses of it approx. 6-8 degrees above the horizon heading towards the clouds, and then it disappeared. Since we live in the countryside, it is difficult to judge whether there was sound, as agricultural machines and cars drive around in the distance, so possibly sound from the object would be difficult to distinguish from other sounds, but I could hear nothing from that direction. A helicopter would have made a lot more noise. If the object had not moved as it did, I would have thought it was a normal airplane or a helicopter. In fact, I later thought it was returning, but this was a regular flyer heading north-north-east, its traffic lights alternating between either side of the wings.",

You could just guess that they were moving in a northerly direction. The objects were round, but the distance was great, so it was hard to see if they might have looked different. They were the size of a pea from my point of view. I&#39;ve spent a few days wondering if it was the sun doing some kind of mirroring I don&#39;t know about, but the strange thing about it was that they weren&#39;t at the same height. I would think that one object was approx. twice as high horizontally as the other, and there was also quite a distance between them vertically. The observation lasts approx. 8-10 minutes, then they disappear behind a cloud cover that was about to move in over the city. After the last one disappears, I think I can sense one more disappearing behind the cloud. The date must be taken with reservations, it may well have been 1-2 days before or after.",

        "content": "One morning surprise on Constitution Day, 5 June 2018, I see something really striking. It was around 07:22 in the morning, when I had just walked out the door from my apartment and then had to go over to my car, which was parked 30-35 meters ahead. I manage to take only 4-5 steps forward, after which I look up into the clear sky, a beautiful almost transparent moon and a white cigar-shaped object flying directly past the Moon and quietly moving forward to the right. I pick up my stupid mobile phone, and it takes me 12 seconds to, first of all, find my phone, unlock it, go into camera, switch to video, and finally start filming it. I have a video recording of it. But since this thing that I would classify as a &quot;UFO&quot; flies behind a lot of trees and tall buildings, I can no longer see it, which is why I could not film it anymore. A short video, and unfortunately filmed with a measly iPhone 4s. It is difficult to see it in the video on a handheld phone, but if you watch the video on the computer and in zoomed mode, you can spot it. My first thought upon discovery was… is that a strange bird flying? No, impossible, not quite up there around the Moon (almost). Is it a drone? (as my girlfriend also suggested).. eh, I thought that was impossible too, i.e. a drone at a height around the Moon, I don&#39;t think so. My thoughts afterwards, when I ran the video through with my eyes, were also... that it can&#39;t be a drone flying that far away at all. There are no giant drones that can fly so far away that you can see them. If it were an ordinary drone, and if it could fly that far, I doubt you could see it clearly with your eyes. Also the weird shape? It was definitely not a plane, I thought, especially since there was no smoke or anything coming out the other end. Not only that the speed of the object was somewhat faster than an airplane.",

Thinking ok, there are some fireworks in December and looking away. A few seconds later focus again on the object, bearing in mind that I have previously seen the same sight a year or two back a kilometer away from our residence, in a southerly direction. Now I&#39;m absolutely sure, it&#39;s neither fireworks nor flares. The object moves quietly further south. The weather is overcast and the air hazy, but the glowing orb stands razor sharp and pulsates a bit like some kind of star beaming, still in a mixture of red and orange. A little minute has passed and the light fades and disappears completely. I think the distance to the object is between two or three hundred meters, maybe more than half a kilometer, which is the distance down to the big lake in Jyderup.",

At this time there are no clouds in that part of the sky and think that at first it might be a very clear planet or star. Turning off at the intersection to pick up a pizza further down the street. When we get back to the intersection, we will stop for red again. K is now approx. 23.14. Looking skyward again, we see that there are now 2 more lights, all styled like the first one we saw. They stand in the sky as a larger slightly lopsided triangle with 2 lights evenly spaced and the 3rd with a greater distance to the 2, but in a way strategic in relation to each other. We drive on a road through the city, which is open with a clear view of the sky. As we watch, the 3 lights change from a triangle to a line across the sky. A very clear but calm shift, and we stick to the side and get out to be sure that we are being cheated by sounds from any. helicopter. Since I myself have an understanding of flying, I could not see anything related to airplanes or helicopters. And the way the formation changed direction was also out of the ordinary of flight. borders. I get 2 very weak pictures taken from the mobile phone and after 25-30 seconds the lights disappear one by one. At the same time, clouds have started to come over the city. During this whole process the lights were in the same air space in the sky and when we saw the other 2 lights they were considerably closer than when we observed the first one and all were below cloud level. The 2 lights have not been covered by buildings or clouds when they appeared.",

I hurriedly called my wife so she could see it. It moved toward us at normal flight altitude slowly, then it turned north and stood still for a short moment, then it moved more north, then it looked more like a round glowing ball, after which it rose vertically and became smaller and smaller . This happened in 3370 Melby. We thought it was an unusual experience, so we would be happy if we could get feedback from you. PS.: There was no sound of any engine.",

        "content": "Over the last 2-3 years I have observed these lights around 8-10 times on my way to work in Copenhagen. Always at approx. same time - around 22.40 to 23.10, when I have not been able to see them anymore. It took place on the section route 155 and route 21, from Svinninge to approx. Taastrup I have stopped a few times, and once looked at them through binoculars, and here, the episode in question, filmed them with my iPhone. The lights themselves look the same from time to time, and are also located in the same place. These are 1-3 strong yellow lights, which alternate to light up, 1, 2 or 3 at a time. It doesn&#39;t look like they are moving, not even between each other. The intensity appears to be constant. In the videos it looks like the intensity varies a lot, but it doesn&#39;t look like that when you look at them with the naked eye. And not even the one time when I looked through binoculars. The distance is impossible to say, but they are far away, as I have, most times, observed them from around Svinninge/Tuse, to Roskilde/Taastrup. The observations have only taken place in the dark months and when the weather has been clear and not cloudy. I actually wanted to see if I couldn&#39;t get a better recording with a better video camera with optical zoom and image stabilization before I contacted you. But unfortunately I haven&#39;t observed the lights since May 1, and have now switched to the day shift. So I probably won&#39;t see them again unless they also occur early in the morning. I have wondered a lot about what it could be. I am convinced that it is not spaceships, airplanes, hot air balloons, astronomical phenomena, street lamps, fireworks, emergency flares, laser lights, etc., as the characteristics of the lights do not match with some of these. I have loosely figured out the direction via various places, I have observed the lights, and Google Maps, and have got a direction around Frederiksværk. But I am far from certain that it is exactly there. However, I have thought about whether there is something military in that direction, and it could be flares in connection with exercises, for example. It surprises me that the lights are in the same place every time. But in the first of the videos, you can clearly see a flash of light at the ground, and two seconds later a ball of light appears. I have not noticed that before, nor by the observation itself. I first saw that on the video itself. However, it is only seen once. I don&#39;t know if it is something you have the time and desire to go into, but my curiosity is piqued, and it could be that it was something you had heard about before.",

I called my wife and told her to come and see something strange. The light moved further to the left and stood still again. Then it moved to the right again in a long gliding motion, stopped and descended beyond the horizon. I thought that was it and did something else for a few minutes. I looked out the window again and saw that now there was a new luminous object, this time glowing red. Meanwhile my wife had come upstairs and we both stood watching the phenomenon. The new object behaved in the same way as the other. Smooth movements to the left and right, and all the time at the same height.

The distance from the observation point was between two and three kilometers, and the height above the ground lower than the lowest flying passenger planes in the area. If it was an object, it must have been considerably larger than a large airliner. The phenomenon moved slowly, horizontally, stopped for a few seconds, where it stood still, (did not get smaller, i.e. did not give the impression that it was standing still, because it was moving away from the observer), then continued on the same course, stood still again , after which it suddenly became invisible.

        "content": "Saw an anomalous shape hovering in the air - hard to judge the distance, but will shoot at 500 - 1000 meters. It was about 1 cm wide at arm&#39;s length. The object changed shape: From a kind of deformed square (diamond-like) to a more oval (vertical) egg shape. This transformation happened several times. But so quickly and with great precision, an explanation of a loose pressing or similar swirling around seemed lacking given the way the shape changed. Because when it had this ruder shape, it was very insistent without transformation, and the way it changed shape was not characterized by spinning around itself. It sort of happened too quickly, and once it had assumed the more geometric pane shape, it sort of maintained the geometry without changing shape. I tried to explain to myself that it could be a weather balloon/plastic or something. eq., and that the changing shape could be different shades on the balloon, but the metamorphosis was almost too extreme. And despite the distance, it was initially very clear in terms of shape. There was also a slightly darker &quot;dirty&quot; area in the middle - but rather amorphous. During the observation, it &quot;slipped&quot; farther north/northeast, and became a bright spot. We had to put our heads back a little at the start of the observation, and at the last observation it was approx. 45 degrees above the horizon. The observation was interrupted by my children, so I could not observe its exit. Duration approx. 10 minutes. When my girlfriend managed to see it, she went home to our apartment with our son and then came back - when she came back it had turned into a spot of light further away. The father I was standing next to (our children went to nursery together) also thought it looked very strange and thought the only thing that could explain it was that it must be a piece of pressing/plastic - the way it moved.",

The light decreased in strength the closer it got, thought it must be a plane, but the speed was much higher than you normally see a plane flying over you for 11 km. height. It was now almost above our heads, it was without light, which surprised us, because it had had the sun on its &quot;back&quot;, so it was obviously not the sun that had caused it to shine.!! As it passed over us, it was completely WITHOUT any sound. We saw to our great surprise that it was a sort of cigar-shaped silver-gray body, but what was most strange was that it had 2 large, completely red &quot;funnels&quot; sitting on either side of the FRONT 1/4 of the the body, and they FACED FORWARD IN THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT!!! (the &quot;funnels&quot; turned so that the large opening turned in the direction of flight, and we have no doubt about the color). Our best bet is definitely a satellite, due to the speed and the lack of sound and then of course the strange shape.",

It was far from us, but we could see that there were several different lights, not like an airplane. The lights didn&#39;t sit the same way either. The object could fly sideways and stay still in the air. When we got to my grandson&#39;s home, the object seemed to be standing still in the air, but occasionally it would jump to the side. We picked up my daughter and a pair of binoculars. When we looked through the binoculars, it was clear that a lot of different colors flashed around the object, just as a sharp white light formed a clear outline of the object&#39;s shape - almost hexagonal in basic shape with something like a round tip on top - if you can describe it like this. It was fantastic to see the object in the binoculars as it appeared quite clearly in this form. I told my daughter to call my stay-at-home son and tell him so he could go out to see it. I quickly drove home myself, but had to note that the object was gone.",

The ball of light went slowly to the left (approx. satellite speed) for approx. 3 seconds, then it sped up as it descended and disappeared at the speed of a shooting star. The color of the ball of light was yellow-white. I have never seen anything like it and I was very shocked/surprised. I have always liked to look at stars, satellites and have always sat up for a long time to spot a shooting star. Have seen a lot of them too. However, I have never seen anything like what I did today. Whether it was a spaceship, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t want to say/believe that - but I would call it an unidentified flying object.",

        "content": "My wife and I are sitting on the terrace. She notices a &quot;plane&quot; with its landing lights on, which so often flies over us when CPH runway 22 is used. However, lane 04 was used at the time in question. Soon after, more appear, and this continues for approx. 10-12 min. We estimate that 25-30 objects came. On some of them I thought that together with the strong white light there was also a red beacon light, but it was weaker, so I am unsure about that. At the start of the observation, I estimate that their course was approx. 90g, but they turned off and disappeared at a rate of approx. 120g. The light from them did not dim after changing course, as a landing light would. At first I thought it was a plane that was going to land on runway 12, which was not logical at the time. As it turned out to be such a large cluster of objects close together, landing in the CPH would not be possible at such short intervals. If they had been planes I would estimate their altitude at 4000-6000 ft. and the speed around 200 kt. It should be noted that we could not hear any sound despite the large number. We are surprised that no one else on Zealand has apparently observed the phenomenon, or that it has been able to be ascertained on surveillance radar. We listened to the midnight radio news but there was no mention of it and we haven&#39;t heard anything since. Yesterday, 4/6 approx. at At 00.05 and 00.10 I observed two similar ones, albeit more distant in the north-west direction. Coming from the N and turning towards the SSW.",

I had to check if it was still standing as it should, and here I look vertically up in a southerly direction and at an angle of 85 degrees from me, I see a clear round ball. I have no doubt that this bullet is something I have not seen before. The weather is crystal clear and blue skies. It is held in the air for the approx. 2 min I watch it, only interrupted by the one time I threw out the blinker. To me, it had a reddish streak or streak - maybe from the sun&#39;s rays. Otherwise it was completely shiny and shiny. When I throw out again and look up, it&#39;s gone. After several attempts, I have tried to distance myself, and here it is still difficult for me to distance myself. But if, at my height of 186 cm and an outstretched arm, I bring my index finger and thumb together so that there is a distance of a small centimeter, then it is very likely the size as I saw it. After half an hour, I narrated the episode to my 3 fishing buddies, who could only be there as oral witnesses.",

After approx. 8 - 10 minutes, the extra star started to flutter around, but all the time right around the Chariot and not in any fixed pattern, and it happened in small jerks, there were small pauses of approx. 12 sec. between each jerk. After approx. In 11 minutes, it wandered back to the starting point in the carriage bottom of the Chariot. This time it was only there for a short time, approx. 1 - 2 minutes, after which it disappeared at very high speed in a north-westerly direction. It shone like another star, though much clearer and brighter than the North Star. There was nothing with any color changes that you see in airplanes, just a very bright white light. When it disappeared it was almost like seeing a shooting star, here there was only a very small tail.",

It is a very bright light similar to an approach light, but more reddish and vibrant. The light came directly towards us from Kastruplufthavn in a north/east direction and was observed for a few minutes from a 40° to 80° angle, where the brightness was the same. As the light was passing over us, around the 80° angle, the brightness changed and became fainter but more concentrated reddish and a few seconds after, 85-9° angle, went out completely. And suddenly we could see a very dark outline of a classic disc-shaped shadow step forward and calmly glide over us. We followed it for 3-5 seconds before it disappeared over the building and rushed through the apartment, but all lights were turned off to see if it was visible from the other side. Despite road lighting, it was successful. And it could be followed as a dark faintly quivering blob, which after half a minute to a full minute, disappeared completely out of sight along Peblinge Søen. It was completely round and, from our perspective, about the size of 2 crowns, seen from the second floor at a 90° degree angle. It had no obvious lights to see anymore, but it still looked faintly glowing or shimmering. The speed appeared to be constant, estimated at 150-250 km/h, depending on the altitude, which is estimated to be between 1-3 km. up.",

The four white, pale, round lights appeared far apart and then raced across the sky with far more speed than an elm. plane and then gathered in a clump of light in the middle and then went off in different directions again after a few seconds. Later they appeared once more and repeated the pattern, much further away from where it happened before, leading me to rule out the possibility that it was a light source on the ground (there were no cones of light either). Then the lights began to &quot;chase&quot; each other across the sky and then disappear. I think for a long time to come up with a logical solution, but still can&#39;t see where it would come from.

It looked exactly like a classic &#39;black triangle&#39;... the only exception to the norm of these was that every time the red light flashed, the two rear white lights did the same. I am still convinced that it was a conventional jet aircraft I saw (due to the engine noise and movement), but this sighting deserves mention as it points to misidentified aircraft as a likely explanation for quite a few sightings of &quot;black triangles&quot;.",

I&#39;m surprised that (the plane) didn&#39;t blink or move, thought it was probably going away from me or right towards it. Nothing happened. I got out of my bed, opened the balcony door, looked closer and listened. No sound. It is difficult to estimate how far away it is when you do not know how big the object is. I stand and watch it approx. 5 minutes Laying back in my bed and still looking at the mysterious light approx. a few min. Plus, the light disappears at a very high speed for me to see to the east with an increase of approx. 15 gr. It had no trail of fire, but moved from zero to a volsom speed of 1.? SEC. It disappeared behind a high-rise building about the fifteenth floor as seen from my bed. A stretch of approx. 1 m. Falling asleep and actually forget the episode, but Wednesday morning, read the Jyllandsposten before I had to go to work. Saw in a smaller article that in Frederikshavn and Skagen, on the night of Monday, a mysterious light was observed disappearing at great speed in a south-easterly direction. I thought immediately, it was exactly the same thing I saw. Have since thought that there are some really good fix points if there is someone who wants to calculate the speed and not least the direction of its possible target.",

I was actually sure it was a meteor I had seen that day, also because it looked like it was speeding up, so I reported it to ildkugle.dk. Monday 05/04 2011 At 21.30 we had a visit from our neighbour, who stood on the terrace and called me, I should hurry up and get out there. Then I saw the exact same light again, just a little dimmer in light and slower than the day before. Couldn&#39;t see where it went because it came so low that I couldn&#39;t see it for a long time because of the neighboring houses. Then I borrowed an old video camera, but unfortunately it was very cloudy for the next several days. So I waited until 14/04/2011 at 21.00 and stood ready with the camera and then got a profit, but unfortunately it shone much weaker and was much slower, so my wife and I talked about whether it could be a plane we had seen, also because that evening it was heading towards Viborg Airport, but we agreed that what we had seen the first few days was not a plane.",

        "content": "Must approx. 21.10 wash dishes. 5-7 degrees above the horizon in a south-westerly direction, I see 2 luminous balls, as they hang over the Jyske dragoons Regiment&#39;s training ground, I think they are &quot;flares&quot;, however I have never seen flares in that color (I myself have been in the defense for 2 years ) the balls first fall towards the ground, but then begin to rise towards the sky. I therefore estimate that it must have been 2 helicopters, but I have never seen helicopters with such powerful searchlights. The spheres rise higher in a northerly direction, but approx. 20 degrees above the horizon, the balls fly in different directions. One ball flies in a 248 degree west direction as it drops in height, then disappears behind a building. The second ball continues to rise in a northerly direction, and approx. 40-45 degrees above the horizon, the light goes out, but I can still sense the black ball, which continues to rise in a northerly direction, approx. 55-60, the sphere stands still, after which I lose sight of it in a 278 degree west direction. The time here is approx. 9.30 p.m. I am a rational thinking person and I do not believe in flying saucers and aliens visiting us, but what I experienced on Thursday night I cannot explain. There are quite a few helicopters flying around over Holstebro (medical helicopters, military helicopters), but I have never seen helicopters move like these two UFOs did, and I have never seen a helicopter fly so high into the sky. If you have any other information or know what I saw that night, please write back to me. I also managed to take a picture of the glowing balls with my Ipad, but the picture quality is very poor (of course).",

        "content": "My girlfriend and I are watching TV, we zap between TV2 (World Cup summary) and a broadcast on Investigation Discovery. At is here 22.23. I then see a clearly luminous &quot;ball&quot; out of the window, moving from west to east. I see this glowing dot or ball between the blinds, and fly off the couch and pull the blinds apart. I observe the light moving east for approx. 2-3 seconds before I call my girlfriend so she can see it too. We observe it together in the window for approx. 7-8 seconds until a tree blocks the view of the light. We literally both jump over the couch and open our patio door and run out to look. I start my phone camera and film the object for 8 seconds until it disappears over a building. The object disappears due east. While I&#39;m standing there filming, my girlfriend has run along the building where it disappears, and she thinks the object is rapidly increasing in speed and disappearing. The object appeared to have a pulsating distinct white/yellow light. A very strong light I thought. It wasn&#39;t really dark outside yet, and the sky was pretty much completely overcast. The object was VERY clear! Possibly because there were no other luminous objects to be seen in the sky such as stars and the moon. That was probably why I discovered the light through the blinds to begin with. I want to shoot the object and fly low. I think this is because the clouds were low. I would suggest that the object has been approx. 500 meters up in the air. The object generated no sound at all... at least nothing we could hear. My girlfriend is absolutely convinced that it was NOT a plane, and she was slightly shaken and elated by the experience. She was very surprised that it made no sound at all when it flew as low as it did. We could not see any form of the object, although it was flying low. It just looked like a shiny ball of some sort. It was certainly not flying slowly, but I dare not guess at the speed at which the object was moving. During the entire observation, the object appeared to maintain the same speed. It is only my girlfriend who saw (or seemed to see) that the object speeded up tremendously until finally disappearing. One thing is certain in my mind, and that is that if the object had kept the same speed the whole time, then the object should be visible when my boyfriend and I come around the parking lot. The time we spent running in and putting on shoes and grabbing a shirt on the dining table next to the patio door did not exceed 17-20 seconds (we timed it with a stopwatch during a subsequent reconstruction). The person we meet out on the road seems very much influenced by his own experience of the object. I don&#39;t know exactly how he experienced it, but he was very much affected by it anyway. I have NEVER seen an unidentified flying object before, neither has my boyfriend. But we both think it was unlike anything we had seen before.",

The object emitted a very strong white flash followed by a somewhat weaker one. After that again a strong. That&#39;s how it went on. There was also a red and a blue-green light - not particularly strong in the direction of flight. The speed of the object was faster than an airliner, but significantly slower than a fighter. Suddenly it changed course and was now flying due north. I estimate its flight height to be approx. 4-5000 m. I opened the window to listen for engine noise, but there was not a sound. Meanwhile, the object disappeared from my field of vision. Due to haze, I could not see any contours. Only the lighting effects mentioned above. If anyone else has seen something similar, I&#39;d love to hear about it.",

I lay still. And using the door frame of the patio door, I could see how it moved. Come closer. Fly zig-zag. Became stronger in color. Fly further away. Come closer. Repeatedly. At almost 3 now and it&#39;s still there. Woke up my husband and he can see it too. Have called my mother. She lives 4 km from here. And can also see it. It has really been big and close down. At eye size half a cm approx. Maybe a little bigger. If I look at a star, it is in my eye measure one mm. Approx.. if you are in Herning, it is beyond Lind.",

        "content": "I had had visitors in the evening, ate good food and drank wine, but was definitely not drunk!! When my guest had gone, about midnight, I cleaned up a little, and then stood up on the windowsill, and with my head stuck out of the upper window, looked up at the night sky. It was something I often did back then before going to bed. The night was not completely clear, there was a slight haze in the sky when you looked up. However, I could easily see the brighter star. Suddenly I saw two orange/reddish lights come flying across the sky, in a straight line from approx. east towards approx. west. I looked at them for a split second before it dawned on me that there was something very strange about these lights. Strange because the lights moved in semi-circles, as if they were on opposite ends of a long pole, which was then constantly tilted back and forth from the center, 180 degrees clockwise and then 180 degrees counter-clockwise. This means that the lights were almost directly opposite each other, and their movements described a reasonably large circle. This unison motion alternating clockwise and counterclockwise didn&#39;t seem particularly fast in frequency.... maybe twice a second. It was therefore easy to follow the movements with the eye. The lights did not flash and were similar in size to regular pilot lights. It was not possible to see any form within this circular form which the movements of the lights formed, either rod-like or plate-like. So it was not possible to see how the lights were connected, or if they were at all. The center of this invisible axis, which was as it were described by this semi-circular motion, moved in a straight line across the sky. There was no sound. It is very difficult to judge distance when looking up, but considering the weather and the fact that nothing could be seen but the lights, I would guess between 100 meters and 300 meters up. The distance between the lights is also difficult to judge, given that the distance as a whole is a bit unclear. If it was now 300 meters up, then it has been a distance between the lights corresponding to about twice as far as a jumbo jet, I want to shoot. So something reasonably large. The object (or objects) flew right over my street, almost right over my house. I rushed up to the roof (lived at the top) to see if I could see them disappearing towards the horizon, but of course they were gone. I can&#39;t say how fast they were. I could see a horizon to the east that was maybe 300 meters away (over the rooftops) and then to where I could no longer see them (as they flew over my house). It went reasonably fast, approx. five seconds from start to finish.",

The height of the object is hard to guess, but I would imagine 5000-10000 feet. I just stood there and wanted to watch as it flew over me, but the object slowed down more and more and then stopped before it passed. After a minute or less it started moving again, but now to the south. Now only the red light was visible, and after perhaps a minute, the object became smaller and smaller and finally disappeared. Have thought about possible causes like satellite or aircraft but just never seen a satellite be so big and clear and change direction. You would also be able to hear a plane, since it was completely silent otherwise. Could be cool with a good explanation.",

Subsequently, I had to observe more closely, as a star does not normally move to the side without leaving the &quot;picture&quot; as e.g. a shooting star. After a short time it instead moved from the side, as well as up, as well as diagonally, and everything happened in a split second, as if it was looking for something or &quot;someone&quot;.

It happened in the winter of 1980, when I was living at home with my parents. I was sitting in my room listening to music when two girls I knew came into my room. They were all driving and yelling at each other saying that they had just seen a UFO land in a field right next to my parents house when they were on their way to me. I told them to calm down and tell me quietly. They said they were on their way back to me and saw some lights of many different colors that twisted around each other like a light show in the field near the road they were driving on. They got very scared and they peaked their puck maxi popped to see what kind of strange light it was. Just then, the light stopped shining, and then there was a large white ufo with windows. They could see there were some people behind the windows. It stood for a few seconds. and hummed a little, and then it flew up into the air and turned to the north. It went very fast approx. two seconds, then it was gone. I&#39;ve always wanted to say that, even though I haven&#39;t seen it myself, it sounds real enough.",

We are aimless. The object can be observed for perhaps 1-2 minutes, after which it suddenly disappears to the west at a very high speed and completely silently. We have never been able to explain the phenomenon ourselves, and even here 30 years later we still talk about the experience. However, we agree that it was something &quot;not earthly&quot; that we saw. For the record, it must be said that the story is 100% true, but at the same time it is the only UFO experience we have had. But we still wonder.

From the time we see it and for approx. 6 sec. it is seen as a clearly luminous, orange-coloured object, slightly elongated in shape across the direction of movement, a bit like a bird/plane. Size is most easily described by a comparison with a buzzard at a distance of 100 - 150 m. Diminishes gradually as it fades to the south and disappears like a slowly fading (extinguishing) star. There is no sound. Observers agree on a description of a satellite debris/low-responsibility shooting star, but wonder about the completely straight trajectory, why our perception is a very large object seen at a great distance, even though we perceived proximity. 3 minutes later (at 11:28 p.m.) a very large (2 - 3 x Jupiter) white light is seen moving from southwest to northeast for about 7 seconds. - quickly becomes smaller to an ordinary satellite size, which can then be followed for another 15 - 20 seconds, now also with binoculars, which do not change the size. This observation only seems strange because of the very large size at the start (could be an unusually strong reflection from a satellite) - and is taken into account in relation to the above completely different, for us, inexplicable observation.",

There was no sound about it at all, and all of a sudden it began to move quietly, and later became smaller and smaller, until at last it disappeared. It looked most like a burning object, but completely without sound. My boyfriend and I watched it from our car, but we noticed a few people who had gotten out of their cars to watch it.",

It has become a little unclear to me whether it was 03. or 07.. Yes, even the year 77 or 78, embarrassing, but otherwise I&#39;ve always been able to remember it. Can ask my sister, but the correct information is in my report from that time. My sister&#39;s husband goes outside to empty a trash can. It is starry, completely windless, at is maybe 19?. Then Jan comes in and says: Come out and see, there is something strange in the sky. My sister and I and their two children look up in the sky - yes, there are three, green, red, white, pulsating round balls, three of them, like connected together, one at the top, two at the bottom, like a triangle. And it is an object that looks like this, the other two in the same way. They are quite a way up in the air above - or in the direction of Koglevej and Krammesvej, where we usually go for a walk, and it is probably three hundred meters away, but the objects may well have been further away. It&#39;s hard to tell, but they were totally clear up there in the air. Well, but they kind of move up and down, a bit slanted, and in straight lines. A long movement can be described as &quot;a shooting star&quot; in speed?, where the UFO from point a shoots off at lightning speed, where it has stopped abruptly - in such an almost straight line. Eg. close to one of the other UFOs. A little later they move a little to the left. They are in these clear colours, pulsating, just as the colors flow together. They now change in shape, and we see a totally beautiful and bright orange, yes, like an airship in shape, bright as the light of the sun. We take turns looking with the binoculars, but see nothing but what we see from the ground, it&#39;s just closer with the binoculars of course. But now there are four? much smaller UFOs away, i.e. transformed into the large luminous object. A short time later, it sets off and moves steadily towards - yes, north-west. It starts on one - as if it immediately had max. velocity. It struck me even then that it moved so immediately. Well, we went for a walk down towards the harbor later that evening. The man who steered the Udbyhøj ferry must also have seen it. It was written in Randers Amtsavis that two sea hunters had seen an orange object, and we knew that it must be the same one we saw, so we thought it was interesting. I am writing about it because others must have seen it and if the same colors and shapes could have been seen elsewhere. I&#39;ll probably never get an answer to anything, but it&#39;s as true as the amen in church. There were no sounds from the UFOs, I must remember to mention. Think how incomprehensible our life is, and scary too I think, it is not something created by humans, what we saw, it is a hundred...",

We&#39;re talking about, it&#39;s a drone with a light on it, but the light is orange/red and they don&#39;t have that. We are considering whether it is a glowing lamp (china lamp), but this can stand completely still and then move again. We look through binoculars and see that it has at least 3 lights in a row, but we can&#39;t see what it is. Then it starts moving calmly towards Sweden, and after a few seconds it picks up speed and disappears straight towards Sweden at a very high speed. It is a very clear evening, no clouds and a full moon that gives us a good clear view. We are hyper-aware that we have seen a UFO - and regret that we did not take a photo or a video.",

        "content": "Part 1, Preben&#39;s part of the story. Around. At 01:15 on 28 May 2001, my friend Alex and I came driving a large van along Juelsmindevej towards Vejle, a few kilometers from the large transport centre. I see a faintly glowing oval object hanging far out on the horizon. I&#39;ll wait a bit to mention it to see if Alex notices. Shortly after, Alex sees it, and we then agree to pull over to the side and take a closer look at the phenomenon. Then we turn off the engine and all the lights in the car, after which we open the door and hear a faint hum in the distance - within 8-9 seconds the oval object has come close to us, in fact so close that it fills more than half of the windshield through which we look. We sit completely still in the car and don&#39;t know what to say or do when a completely white, powerful light &quot;turns on&quot; on the left side of the object, after which the light is almost raised above it and slanted to the left. The object now stands still in front of us and almost &quot;shines&quot; on us for approx. 25 sec., after which it fades out, leaving a large oval hole between the clouds, where you can look out into space, and a thin glowing green line from the hole and diagonally into space, which stands still for a few seconds, after which it fades out and disappears. Then we sit completely speechless for a quarter of an hour, after which we choose to drive on, - we then pass the transport center and shortly after Alex observes 3 completely quadratic objects on the horizon to the right. He points it out to me, and just as we&#39;re both looking at them, they almost close together one by one like a camera lens. Alex then turns his head to the left and discovers a completely quadratic object more near the water tower, - when I look at it too, it closes and disappears in the same way as the other three. After getting really curious, we decide to drive up to the top of a nearby hill and take a closer look at the horizon. When we reach the top and look out to the right, we observe two completely quadratic objects again, we look at them for 5-6 seconds, after which they close together like the other three. We stay as a team on the hill for 10 minutes, observe no more, after which we choose to go home with an experience a little out of the ordinary.",

It is a little after 8 o&#39;clock, the weather is fine approx. 20 degrees and with scattered clouds. By chance, on the left of the windshield, quite far away, I spot a shiny object. Immediately I think it looks like an airplane. And think no more and that until I look out of my side window. The object has not moved much, perhaps a little to the north. Now very sure that it is not a plane anyway. Even if I&#39;m driving on the highway, I try to slow down, but it&#39;s hard to keep the observation. It is therefore quite difficult to judge the distance (perhaps 3-4 km away) and see further details. Just that the object is shiny and oval/oblong. Something I&#39;ve never seen before. There is probably a good explanation behind this object, but which one. It might be interesting to hear if others on the motorway this morning have seen anything similar.",

On top of that, it seemed like it was flying at helicopter height, so quite close, but completely silent. We all got a little puffed up because it was such a sour experience.. It wasn&#39;t a shooting star.. Neither was anyone flying. The object was round, constantly glowing at high speed. But completely silent. Managed to shoot a short video with it.

        "content": "I want to start by saying that I have seen quite a bit in the last six months. In total I have seen 6 unexplainable things. But now I will write to you, because the last thing I saw here last Friday was the wildest of them all. And all my sightings I have seen with one or more witnesses. I have been interested in the sky for a long time and wondered, like a lot of others, if there really was something out there and if it could be that we were alone in the universe. And I&#39;ve read and watched a lot of documentaries over the past year. And also have a lot of questions for you. But to get back to what I saw last Friday. We sat out all evening. I have a friend who is just as into it as I am. He saw something the day before which was a glowing orb on a rainy day.,The sky was completely overcast and it was pulsating white and yellow/orange. And they have a balcony with a reasonably good view. So he called and told about his sighting the day before we were to go in there. But then the day after we came in in the evening. I have to say that all Friday it was cloudy and rainy. Then at 8 pm it started to clear up, and an hour later it was completely cloudless. So we sat out there looking for UFOs. And suddenly there was a light similar to what my friend had seen the day before. Exactly as he had described. 10 minutes after that another one came in the same place, and right after that two more came. So you could see three at the same time. It was crazy! They were flying low, because there was an airliner which passed the three luminous objects. At least it looked like it, but the direction can be deceiving. They came from behind one of the tall buildings in Odense. As I said, it was inside the city, and we sat by a balcony. But I haven&#39;t seen anything like it. They pulsated, and if you looked closely, you could sense that they were spinning around themselves. They were only there for a scant 20 seconds. And it was completely cloudless. They pulsated (brightly and faintly glowed). But when they shone dimly, they were still brighter than the brightest star in the sky. And then suddenly you could see that luminous contracted and disappeared out of the blue. So we were speechless. But this is the first time I am writing to you, and I would very much like to get in touch with you to hear what you have to say about it. Now I will soon buy a good camera so that I can get it on tape and show what I see when I sit and look for UFOs in the evening. I haven&#39;t seen anything about the day yet though. I almost have to tell you about another experience I also had. But that was a while ago. So can&#39;t remember when. But the time has been approx. 01.00. I live in Svendborg in a terraced house and have a reasonably large sky to look at. But that night I had to go out front with my dog so he could pee before we went to bed. Then I look up and there was a great light which was much brighter and much bigger than a star. It stood completely still. And I ran in and got my girlfriend and her sister. Just as we got out, it set into motion and flew over our house. Not directly across, but like that, so we had to run in through and then out into the garden on the other side. It picked up speed more and more. It pulsated the colors red, yellow, green and blue/purple. So yeah... I&#39;m very interested in what you guys have to say about that.",

But we continue to be able to see the light crossing the sky both from side to side and back and forth over the car. At Kolding we switch over to the Esbjerg motorway, and I think that the light will probably continue with the motorway south, but no it turns towards Esbjerg. However, it is as if we have come a little in front of the light, but my daughter, who is almost 12, can still follow it out of the side window. We drive off at Lunderskov and keep on the viaduct over the motorway and see the light zig zag across the motorway. The light continued towards Esbjerg. Was it a police helicopter with a searchlight?",

At first I thought it was the moon, but when there was a bright star-like light at the bottom, I realized it was not the moon. The powerful light looked like a very strong searchlight. I got off the bike and looked at the light. It had a flat oval shape and at the bottom was this bright light. The oval shape was completely illuminated, almost like a giant light bulb. I stood and watched it for a few minutes, also looking around at the rest of the sky to see if I could find the moon. However, it was apparently cloudy, at least I couldn&#39;t see any stars or any moon. The big glowing thing was totally silent. I continued cycling along the Ring Road up to the junction at Tøndervej/Skydebanen. As I cycled I looked at the light. When I got off again at this traffic light, I could see that it had gotten smaller. Either it must have moved, or it must have been quite close when I first saw it, because I cycled about ½ km. from between the two places I got off the bike. I then cycled further up Bjælderbæk by the shooting range, from there I could no longer see it. I think there must be others who have also seen something, since there are a lot of people in town on Friday nights.",

At the same time as two planes pass at different altitudes and in separate directions, I see a faint white light, which is significantly weaker than that which the planes are carrying. There are no flashing lights, like on airplanes. Only this dim white, which at some point I doubt, may be two dim lights. The light moves at roughly the same speed as the planes, but differs drastically in performing maneuvers that I certainly can&#39;t imagine any plane being capable of. First a small vertical dive, then direction directly opposite to the original, another vertical dive, and again the original direction, steep ascent, again opposite direction, steep vertical dive, and again opposite direction. After that, the light can no longer be seen. Whether it went out or went behind a cloud, I could not determine, but it did not become visible afterwards.",

They then moved in a triangle formation towards the direction of the city, stopped dead changed formation again and then moved off rapidly. I gauged the altitude to be under 10000 feet but really there was no reference point to back this up. We are however in the flight path for incoming flights to Kastrup. The whole incident lasted about 10 seconds. The sky was clear and visibility was excellent. I&#39;ve ruled out birds, planes, sky beams etc. It or they were under intelligent control.",

        "content": "I was 12 years old and with a friend in his parents&#39; summer house during the Easter holidays. On a clear sunny day, Easter Sunday, we walked from Sandvig towards Allinge along Kongestien. My companion happened to spot a dull greyish cigar-shaped object moving silently from west to east at a steady downward 20 - 25 degree angle to the surface of the sea. The forward end of the object in the direction of flight was initially orange, in an area of varying size, until it disappeared, as if the object was overheated, glowing from drag. The size was difficult to determine, the distance to it also difficult to determine. But it seemed as if it was at a distance equivalent to more than half way to the horizon line - and if so it was very large, larger than known aircraft, perhaps several hundred meters or more long. When it was close to the surface of the sea it began a shrill, lurching motion (like a swinging plate on a stick) at varying altitudes, then zig-zag maneuvers with such speed and acceleration that no known craft could imitate . Finally the object disappeared at an insane speed heading towards the horizon and disappeared out of sight still close to the surface of the sea. We knew nothing of the concept of UFOs at the time, but when we told my friend&#39;s parents about the sighting the next day, we were made aware of their existence, as acquaintances of the parents were interested in UFOs, and sightings with attempts to photograph them. It was probably a little unusual at the time, and it was only later, when I was 14 - 15 years old, that I became interested in UFOs and read about them - prompted by a classmate. I have since read about UFO sightings - and have become aware that this sighting matches descriptions of so-called mother ships, which should have a size of 1 - 2 km in diameter - and which should be quite rare to see in daylight.",

It quickly appears behind some rooftops, but then slows down and glides slowly across the sky, where it suddenly takes a turn to the west. I pick up my husband who is coming out. Normally he is very skeptical about such things, but here he immediately exclaims: &quot;What the f... is that&quot;. At the same time, another one emerges from the same place, following the same trajectory. We get binoculars and can see that it is almost a flat plate that emits a very strong light all the way around itself. In total, while we stand and watch, 5 balls emerge, all of the same size, color and following exactly the same path. It is completely silent that night, so it was very clear that they did not emit a single sound. I subsequently checked with the local fireworks factory if they had shot anything off, but no, it wasn&#39;t them. For us it was a very mysterious sight that cannot be immediately explained.",

        "content": "At approx. At 22.30 I had gone out into my kitchen, where there is an unobstructed view of Vor Frelser Church tower through the large window. Suddenly I first see a strong organge yellow luminous object fairly high above the top of Vor Frelser Church Tower coming into view from the north and moving in something that could resemble a helicopter speed across the sky towards the south - towards Kastrup Airport. Since we are quite used to seeing ordinary airplanes, whose landing lights are flashing, fly by and pass Vor Frelser Kirketårn here in Christianshavn, I think that it must be an airplane. It surprises me, however, that you cannot hear any engine noise as usual. A short moment later, there are suddenly exactly 3 more of the same size and at the same high speed - and considering the angle and height, they must have been quite large. 10 sec. after that comes another flock of perhaps 10 - 15 objects of exactly the same nature gliding across the sky. I grab my mobile phone and call my mother, who lives in Voldboligerne 2 by Christianshavns Vold and has a beautiful view from her apartment over the rampart and the whole of southern Amager. She rushes into the kitchen and immediately sees - exactly the same strong organ luminous objects. At the same time, even more objects have now come into view from my point of view - and they are flying so close together that they cannot possibly be aeroplanes/helicopters. I agree with my mother to call the police and therefore call 114 - and get hold of it after speaking to a switchboard lady in station Amager and then speak to the officer on duty. He sounds amazed to say the least - and begins to explain something about some Chinese paper lamps with lights in them that you have been able to buy in Copenhagen within the last 14 days. Now it just so happens that, in connection with one of my engagements a number of years ago abroad, I actually witnessed a shipment of such Chinese paper lamps with lights in them - and I can safely say that it could not possibly have been talk about here. When Chinese spirit lamps are sent up, they fly up very slowly - just like when you played with paper kites as a child in Kløvermarken - and they usually stand quite still in the sky and not very high - maybe 10 - 50 meters into the air and later go out and fall back down. This was definitely not Chinese spirit lamps - on the contrary. It was both the amount of objects, height above the horizon and not least the speed was completely wrong. There was absolutely no sound. My mother could also see them, as they all passed at intervals over the Voldbolingerne and out towards the airport, where they gradually disappeared away from her visual range. We assume that there must have been many more people in Copenhagen than us who must have seen the sight. Incidentally, I asked the officer to go outside his office and look for himself, after which he said something about wanting to call back - he hasn&#39;t done that yet. The total number of objects was probably approx. 50 in total - and they came flying either one after the other, then a short break, then another 3 - 4 pieces and then again a break of maybe 2 - 3 min, after which a whole lot appeared at the same time close to the side each other in rapid speed across the sky. If it was supposed to have been Chinese spirit lamps that moved with such speed - the same as an airplane, then there should almost have been a hurricane outside - or strong wind - and as you know, there was not, but completely calm weather and reasonable clear skies. When the large clump of strongly organge-yellow luminous objects had passed, approx. 5 - 10 min, after which 3 objects came again and then again a break of 2 - 3 min, after which a single one came. The whole thing lasted approx. ½ hour to 45 min. After which no more came. Now it&#39;s not like I run around on a daily basis and see UFOs in the sky or see apparitions etc. I can be upset that I didn&#39;t take a picture with my mobile phone camera, instead of calling the police. Even though until yesterday I did not believe in UFOs or life from outer space - and it is mostly a concept that exists in American Sci-FI, action and suspense films such as CIG visual effects - in Steven Spielberg films etc., it could be quite interesting to find out what it was - because the fact was that these many objects appeared in the sky above Copenhagen yesterday.",

I look straight up and spot something dark/black far up, almost like glimpsing a fish down in the water, it was big and already speeding when I saw it, but right as I see it, took the extremely high speed. From when I saw it straight up until it disappeared in the horizon NW, it took less than 1 sec. It was completely surreal and I still can&#39;t get over what I saw. 2 hours later I then find out that it is lightning in that direction. Don&#39;t know if there is a connection?",

At the beginning of the observation, the size has been like the hole in a five-crore held in an outstretched arm. It moved slowly from right to left all the time approx. 30 degrees above the horizon. Furthermore, it looked like it could be a balloon (lighter pear-shaped with the thick end upwards). But the shape changed so that at times it was shaped like a banana, and the way the shape changed could suggest a rotation. My wife also saw the object and also the change in shape. After approx. For 1½ minutes it seemed as if the object stopped - but I now think more closely that it was a change of direction because the size decreased until we could no longer see it (the height above the horizon was constant to me). The height and distance of the object was quite difficult to determine - but there is a high thin cloud cover and the object stayed below this.",

        "content": "I stood looking at the night landscape from my bedroom on the 2nd floor when I spotted a reddish electric light out over the Århus bay. orange light. My first thought was that it was a planet, but quickly realized that the object&#39;s brightness was significantly stronger than even the brightest planets. Then thought about whether could be a rescue helicopter, which is often seen out over the bay. I retrieved my binoculars, located the object again and adjusted the scope to see if there were any flashing navigation lights to be seen. It wasn&#39;t there, which could also rule out that it was the landing light from a scheduled plane heading towards Tirstrup airport. In terms of perspective, it seemed like the lights were 5-10 kilometers away, so it would fit very well that the objects might be near the airport. Shortly after, 2 more lights appeared. The funny thing is that it looked to me like they suddenly turned on 3-4 degrees above the horizon. There are no objects in this direction that they could be hiding behind. It is approx. here that it occurs to me that they are moving quite slowly upwards at the same speed, although not a constant speed. They also hover alternately from side to side, without violent fluctuations in their trajectory. Their movements made me think of motorized paragliders. Eq. After approx. 5-6 minutes of slow ascent, the lights quickly dimmed and disappeared, all approx. at the same height. I could faintly see cloud cover around where they disappeared, so guess they disappeared into this. I&#39;ve thought about it, and the closest explanation I can come up with myself is probably some kind of paper lantern. However, I do not recall that these move that high into the sky, unless you use a long-lasting form of fuel at the bottom, such as a tealight - however, the brightness of the objects and the immediate distance (which seemed to me to be at least 2-3 km) were much too strong for it to have been the kind of paper lantern that we know from Asia (and now also at home). I certainly don&#39;t believe in UFOs, so the explanation about the lanterns is probably still the one I lean towards the most. However, I think it would be quite fun if someone with a little more experience in this kind of phenomenon could give a better offer, as I myself have a little doubt about my conclusion.",

I went with my parents one Sunday to visit my grandfather, who had a house on Lucernevej in Rødovre. The approach route to Kastrup airport almost went over my grandfather&#39;s house, so it was exciting to stand and observe the different types of aircraft that came over. On that day in September, there was, as usual, traffic in the air. It was a typical autumn day with cloudy weather, and I notice that there is a Fokker Freindship (twin-engine domestic plane with turboprop) on approach with the landing wheels out, it was from SAS by the way. The plane is coming from the direction of Ballerup and is probably about 3-400 meters up, since it is almost in front of me, an extremely fast flying object comes in a curved path up from the clouds and lands about 10 meters behind the tail of the plane at the same speed like the plane. It looked like it was coming at 2000 km/h and stopped at the same speed as the plane in a fraction of a second! The shape of the object was pear-shaped and it flew with the wide end forward, the color was matte black/metal, it had no wings, but closely resembled a bulb painted black, and there was no sound except for the aircraft engines. By comparing with the size of the plane, I would think that it had a size of approximately 8 meters long and 4-5 meters wide. It flew at the same speed as the plane for 25 - 30 seconds, after which it sort of &quot;stopped&quot; and with an incredible speed (I could hardly see it, it was going so fast) disappeared in an arc in the clouds again. I was completely stunned and ran to my mum and dad shouting: I just saw a flying saucer, their response was of course, it&#39;s good with you kid, you&#39;ve shown too much imagination. It was fantastic to see again, because I had seen something similar once before, but I can always tell about that another time. I am 48 years old today, but I will never forget that day in 1971.",

The object was black, and at first we thought it was a large hobby helicopter drone, but then suddenly we could see that it was rotating slowly on itself in the air, such that any horizontal propellers would have turned vertical at least once in this rotation of the object. It was not pure rotations in a fixed path, but the rotating movement took place at a speed that I would estimate to be approx. 4 seconds per rotation - i.e. not particularly fast and probably much in the style of a cut, black plasic garbage bag being carried by a gentle breeze. The object flew/hovered in a path that could easily be a straight line, and its translational speed could also resemble a plastic bag being carried by a breeze. However, the object appeared more rigid than a plastic bag, in a way that gave me the impression that it was an airborne plate in rotation. At times the object rotated into a position so that it became completely invisible to us, as if the plate shape had its thinnest side oriented towards us, and shortly thereafter the object rotated further into a position so that we could see it again. I might be able to build a toy kite out of black garbage bags and carbon fiber rods with the same flying and hovering properties as the object we saw, but I&#39;m not so sure that this kite would be able to rotate in the same way and still move on a reasonably straight line. I therefore cannot fully see what we have probably seen. Do you have any suggestions? Or have you received other reports about this object?",

My dog and I are walking down the field/plot on Brahmsvej, suddenly we are illuminated by a strong narrow beam of light from behind, look behind and see an object coming at an incredibly high speed, it flies over us and suddenly, after a few seconds the light disappears and there is nothing to see in the clear sky, actually expecting a bang, as I have read about in Russia by meteor, but here it is just completely quiet. The speed of the object is significantly faster than an airplane. Don&#39;t know if there has been anything on the radar at Aalborg airport, which is on the other side of the Limfjord. Have grown up with the Northern Lights and have lived on the Thule base, never had anything like this.",

        "content": "I came driving on the E45 in a northbound direction between Horsens and Skanderborg. I spotted a stationary flashing object up in the air (at a position equivalent to about 11:30 as seen from the driver&#39;s seat of a car - if that makes any sense?) I thought the object was far too high up to be a warning flash on a mast or chimney. At the same time, I know that there are no masts or tall chimneys in that area, as I often drive on the stretch. The closer I got to the object, the more I realized that it was something I have not seen in the sky before, mostly because I could tell that the object was completely stationary, and I mean COMPLETELY as seen from the driver&#39;s seat of a moving car . I had to stay in the emergency lane. It turned out to be directly opposite the object, which I thus had at 9 for me. More or less immediately, it moved away in a leisurely motion and at a slow pace, I would say, southward in a straight line. It looked like a slow gliding and calm movement. Maybe there were a few short stops along the way, because I could see it for a few minutes out of the rear window. As best I could see there were three or four small flashing red lights that were around an object (I couldn&#39;t see any kind of object, just the lights) Between each of the red flashing lights were white ones, too flashing light in a kind of rays. It&#39;s hard to say anything about the height, but try the idea of flashing lights at the top of a television mast. Which, however, is far too high up for it to be a &quot;mast&quot; light. I can&#39;t say anything about the compass direction, because I don&#39;t know the coordinates of the starting point. But I know roughly where I stopped and might be able to find it again.",

        "content": "Saturday 15/12/07 in the evening I went into my bedroom, which faces north. You can see the Rigshospitalet from my bedroom. I often look straight out into the backyard, towards the Rigshospitalet or towards the night sky without turning on the light in my bedroom, as I personally like the dark. Astronomy has always been a great interest and therefore a dark room is natural for me. This evening I saw something that I have never seen in my life. Up towards the night sky at a height of about 40-50 degrees above the horizon, i.e. fairly high in the sky, I saw two objects which in size, appearance and brightness reminded me of Venus, except that both objects were orange. They stood completely still in the night sky without blinking, and there was a distance between the two objects of approximately 5 degrees. This means that one object was approximately 5 degrees higher in the night sky. I continued to observe the objects for approximately 10-13 minutes without any movement whatsoever, until suddenly the uppermost object began to move at a relatively steady pace obliquely upwards at a 50-60 degree incline from its original position, it was in. Over the course of a few minutes (3 minutes?), the top object got smaller and smaller until it was finally the size of a faint star in the night sky. At this time, the second object began to move in the same direction, obliquely upwards with the same inclination of 50-60 degrees, until, also after some minutes, it could no longer be seen in the sky. The whole episode lasted about 20 minutes. At the time of their disappearance, they probably had a height of approximately 60-70 degrees in relation to the horizon. During the episode and afterwards, I searched my brain for what it was that I had actually observed. Since I am interested in astronomy, I have spent almost my entire life looking at the night sky and therefore seen almost every object you can find out there in the dark. It must be said that I have never seen any strange objects in the night sky that could not be explained naturally, until now. You cannot find two natural orange objects in the night sky as bright in brightness as Venus that move suddenly. Therefore it must be something else. I thought of two options, either two helicopters or maybe anti-collision lights from aircraft. Regarding helicopters, the height of my sighting seemed to be well above the height that helicopters travel. I also don&#39;t know of any helicopters that stand still in the night sky for 10-13 minutes without flashing, then move diagonally upwards and disappear in about 3 minutes. As for anti-collision lights, that light may be orange, but again, I&#39;ve been watching planes in the sky all my life and have never seen anything like this phenomenon. I was also aware of whether it might be an optical illusion. Over the Rigshospitalet and the city as a whole, there is always an orange glow in the night sky, which could perhaps induce an optical illusion, but I would immediately reject it as the case here. Firstly, the observation was not over the Rigshospitalet, but further west in relation to the building, and it was so high in the sky that the orange glow of the city does not bother. It was against a background of starry night sky. In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not know exactly what it was that I was looking at, but since for many years (over 20 years) I have observed the night sky and all natural (stars, planets, meteorites, etc.) and unnatural ( airplanes, helicopters, satellites, the space station, etc) objects, I can calmly say that what I saw on 12/15/07 for about 20 minutes is something new that I have never seen before in my life. For those who may think that I am a conspiracy theorist or similar, I can say that I am a doubter by nature and always seek to find a natural explanation for everything I experience in life.",

As I throw the rubbish out, I see a car driving from the neighboring house. I turn to walk back towards the house, out of the corner of my eye I see a fast moving light that catches my attention. It moves &quot;horizontally&quot; &quot;along the road&quot; and when I manage to focus on it, it moves upwards at a soft 90 degree angle and disappears immediately afterwards. I can&#39;t really see it properly. It moves much faster than a normal plane, (which I see and hear in the sky in another place shortly after.) There was no sound and the light seemed bigger than what I have usually seen at normal. airplane in the sky at night. But since I can&#39;t really judge what height it was at, it&#39;s hard to comment on the size. However, I would say that it was somewhat lower than the plane that I saw in another place in the sky shortly after. I believe I saw 2-3 &quot;connected orbs&quot; of light in a warm white/yellow color.",

They formed a formation like a triangle, two of these objects switched places very quickly. They pulled out in a large triangle before regrouping in the smaller formation they had flown in earlier. They were silent. I know for sure that these were not planes, as I have previously worked at Copenhagen Airport for many years, both at SAS and as Security at the Airport. Furthermore, I had another experience very recently. Date: 27-02-2020. At approx. 05:45 I also stood on my balcony smoking, when I looked up at the sky I saw what looked like a satellite and followed it as it flew. The strange thing was that it was not alone, flying approx. 25 pcs. right after each other, at the same interval and with the same speed and color as a satellite. In two places there was a gap in the formation where they skipped a link. I tried to film it with my phone, but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t work. I went in from my balcony, and approx. under a minute I simply had to go out again to see if I had seen wrong, but no...the last 3-4 pieces flew by and then it was over. Admits that there were many thoughts that flew through my head, such as &quot;could it be an unknown &#39;defense system&#39;&quot; or a preparation for an invasion&quot; and had to laugh at myself for the last thought. Originally from Copenhagen, but after I moved to Næstved about 3 1/2 years ago, I have seen a total of 4 things in the sky that I have not been able to explain.",

It swirled and kind of danced in the air and stopped, where it just no longer had the yellowish light, but was just tin colored/metallic grey. Since I didn&#39;t have my 400mm super telephoto lens with me, I had to make do with what I had, the 16-55mm lens and immortalized it with 3 photos. I don&#39;t need any scientific intelligence explanation from you guys as I know these exist and don&#39;t think it&#39;s a sentation as I&#39;ve seen it before 3 times..

We looked for it and spotted it again further away and it disappeared again to appear further away where it disappeared again and we didn&#39;t see it again. I don&#39;t know what it was, but I&#39;ve never seen anything like it before. As we stood looking up to see if it could be seen anywhere, a white light now appeared, coming from the west and slowly flying towards the east. This light was not strong, and it disappeared only when it got far away from us. My guess is that neither of these 2 things were airplanes, as the speed and altitude seemed wrong for an airplane. Hope that more people have seen the same as us on this starry evening.",

Now it must be said, we have quite a few planes and helicopters above and close to our house in Silkeborg due to Karup airport. This observation I made was strange because: I thought it was a plane/helicopter, but because of an orange-red (like a fire) slightly more luminous and not flashing color, I became aware. It flew at a medium speed, but it was still different from the normal planes, that&#39;s why it caught my interest. No sound at any time at all. I ventured in and found my binoculars and saw no outlines of any burning plane, instead it made a small loop and flew away from me so that I could see outlines in the center of the orange-red, a wreath of approx. 6 pipes. If it were to be a fighter plane, then it would be anything but silent, and then the very flaring light wouldn&#39;t follow either. Observation time approx. 1½ min. Southeast direction. Now I am writing to you. Whether it is strange types of aircraft that make stopovers in DK, compared to Libya, I should not be able to say, but I have a fairly good grasp of aircraft knowledge.",

        "content": "I was standing out on our balcony smoking my pipe, suddenly I saw five sparkling orange lights and a small white light appear from the southeast. I could see that they were not fliers, because the five orange lights and the small white light were flying lower, perhaps down around the 7th floor level as seen from our second floor apartment block. There was absolutely no engine noise from the five orange lights and the small white light. The front orange light flew higher, maybe it was the leader that flew a little higher above the other four orange lights and above the small white light that flew behind the four orange lights. The four orange lights and the white small light flew in a straight line. I would expect that the distance between all the orange lights and the small white light flew approx. 300 meters from where we were standing. I ran in to get my cell phone which has a camera + video camera. My family asked me what&#39;s going on, why are you running? I told that there was something that I have never seen up in the sky before, so we were 3 people who saw the orange lights, I tried to film the 5 orange lights, but it was too dark outside. We have a view of a gray company building and the Vestforbrændingen&#39;s chimney.",

The sky is cloudless and the sun is sharp from the west. I follow this plane for 2-3 minutes. Suddenly I see from the north that there are 2 round discs the size of a 1 crown (in outstretched arm) with a black underside, and the hole in the middle is very white and shines with incredible power. These two &quot;vessels&quot; are followed parallel to each other with, as I see it, with approx. 1 cm distance. The altitude is below what the charter plane flies, I would say about half that, maybe 5 km up. They fly very fast - and suddenly one turns slightly to the east and dissolves itself in the air?? The other continues to the southeast to also dissolve after approx. 7 sec. Neither of the two &quot;vessels&quot; form condensation streaks or anything else after them.",

At first thought shooting star but as it neared .. the end.. I could clearly see fire and tail .. a total of 2 - 3 seconds.. before it disappeared behind the ridge of the neighboring house. I was lucky to have my distance glasses on, which I use when I occasionally look at the stars - so it was razor sharp. A shame I didn&#39;t have my mobile at hand so I could film it.. but it didn&#39;t last long... but I picked it up for the compass.

I remember turning my head towards my girlfriend and was about to kiss her when her face suddenly lit up with a bright blue/white color. (A bit like the color of a blue halogen lamp.) I quickly turned my head towards the window and saw something inexplicable. Two triangle-like angles, slightly offset from each other, came rushing towards the sky and, as it were, dived in a soft arc towards the ground and looked directly into space. It went so fast that I sat up, looked at my girlfriend and asked her what she had seen. She had seen a little more than me. She had seen them sort of fly in waves down towards the ground and out towards space a few times, and suddenly they flew straight out into space. We were both 16 and we never reported it as we kind of just put it away. But every now and then when we look up at a clear sky we hope that we will get a glimpse of it again.",

I would estimate the size of the object from where we see it to be the size of a large full moon. From standing completely still in the sky, the object begins to move slowly horizontally, all the while shrinking within a relatively short distance and eventually disappearing.

On May 5, 1995, the day after the 50th anniversary of Denmark&#39;s liberation, (where there had been a &quot;happening&quot; in Kirke Såby the night before, which ended with a huge torchlight procession with about a thousand people with torches). Now all 3 of us saw it, it looked like this &quot;Nilfisk top&quot; again, it was very very low down, and suddenly it almost tilted so that we could see the bottom, but then the shape suddenly became elongated and triangular to look at, and it flew very silently slowly across the edge of our section in a north to south direction. This time, my husband had followed the whole process with binoculars, and he said that it was almost brownish in this triangle-like bottom and so massive to look at that he could not actually describe the material, but the closest description was a &quot;very brown finely plowed soil &quot;, because it almost had a &quot;raked&quot; bottom in longitudinal stripes, but still that very massive material to look at. We have talked many times that we wondered what it was that we had seen, and whether that day there was a test flight of the new low-flying American planes, and that there must be others who had seen it, when it was of 2 laps, and precisely because it went so low, but totally silent and no light to be seen, but of course it was also sunshine from a cloudless sky.",

Sometimes they flashed and flew around in a swarm. At one point two of them lit up and flew down towards the ground, where they disappeared, and after a while they flew up again. Sometimes they also disappeared completely, and just as suddenly 10 of them appeared again. We stood looking at it for over an hour. After which it got too cold so we went home. It can probably still be seen now, fantastic experience!",

        "content": "I had just come home from night work and went out onto my balcony on the 4th floor above Bodenhoff&#39;s Plads when I observed an orange light coming floating down Bodenhoff&#39;s Plads approx. 30-40 meters up. As it sailed past me I would estimate I was about 10 meters from it. The object was the size of a football, possibly larger if I had been a meter away from it. It shone with a strong red-orange light, which gave it the shape of a so-called morning star or Christmas star, i.e. jagged. It moved silently and dimly up the street, passed me and continued beyond Copenhagen&#39;s harbour. The speed was approx. 15 km per hour. When it was around Kongens Nytorv, it quietly changed its course to the west. At the same moment a similar one came from the same south-easterly direction, and it behaved exactly identically to the first in height, speed, brightness, stillness and course. It followed exactly the same trajectory as the first one. Both &quot;UFOs&quot; were very beautiful. They were clearly together. This is not about mistaken observations of meteors. They don&#39;t fly so slowly or so far down - in that case Copenhagen would have been in ruins. It wasn&#39;t an emergency flare either. They move high up in the sky, then fall. The two UFOs flew horizontally at the same height over Copenhagen, while I could follow them. Bodenhofss Plads is very quiet at night. You can hear a pin drop, and it&#39;s 100 per cent. certain that the objects were completely silent. They couldn&#39;t have been balloons either, if they had had an engine I would have heard that, and if they were just filled with helium and a burner they wouldn&#39;t be able to hold such a steady course but would have been shaken off the wind. They were clearly driven forward by something hitherto unknown. And I&#39;m not Christianshavn&#39;s village madman. A fireball or ball lightning cannot move as determined either, i.e. follow a completely determined course, which includes a turn to the left, which was also executed in the same way.",

I say that it&#39;s probably a helicopter or maybe a star, I look at the light in a bit of wonder, and at the same time my wife gets a pair of binoculars, she looks at the light and says that it&#39;s behaving strangely, after which I get a pair of glasses. ship&#39;s binoculars and, when I catch the object in the binoculars, find that it is a similar reddish object swirling around within an area that we can both fix with the binoculars. It almost looks like a luminous snake that winds around at a fantastically high pace and at times takes the form of a ring. In the binoculars it looks as if it is moving within a small area, but this cannot be the case because it is so far away that it disappears behind the clouds twice before being seen again. Before I picked up the binoculars, I also saw a small 2-4 person plane that passes in our field of vision much closer than projected, but it has disappeared further from its route before I am back with the binoculars. The last thing we see of the object is that it disappears again behind a large cloud, after which we lose eye contact with it. WHAT could it have been?",

My sister&#39;s dog (Border collie) was with me outside, it ran up and down the stairs and put a ball at my feet, after which it went down into the garden, lay down and waited for me to throw it out to it again. Which I didn&#39;t. So it just lay there and waited. It was quiet and peaceful, just a light breeze. Suddenly it stood up, but its gaze turned to the southwest. It was alert, fully tense, it barked, laid down and then ran into the house. I thought it had been scared of a cat or something in the dark, and went out on the stairs and looked. In the sky approx. 30 degrees above the horizon in a south-westerly direction there was a red glowing orb. My first thought was that it was a big plane. Suddenly, it dropped, very quickly, to approx. 10 degrees above the horizon, after which it quickly rose again to the same height as before. It then moved faster than a plane and slower than a satellite in an easterly direction, over the house, so that from my position it came up in approx. 80 degrees. At that point I ran into the house for a camera. When I came out it was on the other side of the house for a long time. From the other side of the house I saw another red ball in an easterly direction approx. 50 degrees above the horizon. Much further away than the first mentioned. It was gone after approx. 1½ min., in the east. The first one was moving at the same speed as when I was on the other side of the house, in the same direction as number two bullet. To the east. The whole experience with no. one bullet lasted for approx. 15 - 20 min., and the sky was sporadically covered with clouds. My thoughts were many as to what it could be. First a plane that was about to crash, but it went up again. Maybe someone flying a night dragon of some sort. But that was out of the picture when it got closer. A satellite, a space shuttle that was about to land, a large military helicopter... The thoughts were/are many, but whatever it was, it was exciting and I hope you can help me with what it could have been.",

However, the object was not clear, it almost seemed to be easier to see through, approx. 80% visible. To me it almost looked like two vertical &quot;plates&quot;, black and white, continuous, but with a slight angle. As I said, there was no light on the object, just as there was no sound either, it slid across the sky just below the cloud cover in a straight line coming from the east, sliding to the west. Steady speed, without changing direction or altitude, although once it seemed to disappear into the clouds. As mentioned, I first thought of a large bird, but it soon dawned on me that it was partly too large, and also not organic in its shape. It was reasonably clear with plenty of moonlight, and sound-wise I could make out the sounds of airplanes from the airport in the distance before and after, and still not a sound as the object slid across the sky above me. I have no idea what it could be, and being the rational person that I am, have gone through all the logical explanations in my head, and still cannot find a rational explanation for the object. Maybe you can help, I hope so.",

Then it changes shape to what is best described as a parachute or jellyfish shape still with &quot;lightning&quot; in it. And then it disappears again.",

The first two were close to each other and approx. 200 m after, 2 new fireballs came floating. The last one came approx. 300 m from the others. They hovered over the sunroof of my car so I could look right up at them. They were very large and completely silent, and they floated in the same direction towards Ringsted and at the same pace. Approx. 1 month later I saw a ball of fire similar to the one in the afternoon coming up over the horizon at Vridsløsevej in Næstved. It disappeared into a garden at the end of Vridsløsevej. It was even bigger than the others I had seen on June 18th. Have given them a lot of thought afterwards. They made a big impression on me. I got a picture of 2 of them from June 18, but unfortunately it was taken in poor resolution, but you can see them in the picture.",

Then it floated south and then stopped again. There it changed to a green color, and of course that surprised me a lot, then it couldn&#39;t have been an ordinary plane. It then moved relatively quickly to the right and stopped, then quickly to the left and stayed there for maybe 1 minute. Then it changed color again to white/red and flew to the northwest slightly descending until I couldn&#39;t see anymore because of the trees and houses. I waited approx. 10 minutes, but then no more to it. I&#39;ll try again tonight, same time, to see if I can see it again.",

It was moving slower than a plane.. but seemed to be at about the height I usually see the planes flying here - But there was NO &quot;chem trail&quot;.. whatever we call it in Danish?? (No white smoke). I followed the light with my eyes until it suddenly disappeared into nothingness!?.. Is this like satellites doing that? Went home with the idea of writing to you.. When I got home, I looked out the window (about where I saw the UFO).. can hardly believe it myself - the first thing I spot is the SAME white light ! This time it moves faster, again at the same height.. WITHOUT CHEMTRAILS! Took out my phone to take a picture - but it was too far away to see it on the camera... Followed it with my eye until it disappeared into the blue - finally it seemed to fly further away in the same direction as the light became less and less. It was 21:40-21:50 when I saw them. It was/is still bright outside!",

At 23:30 I observed an unusual light about the size of the moon, standing low in the southern sky - A strong yellowish light, shaped like a downward facing backward flame approx. 1 finger width above the moon. I sat by the back wall in my south-facing living room (about 4 meters from the window) on the 4th floor. There are 3 reasonable windows, as well as a terrace. The flame moved with great speed, west to east. When the flame/light appeared in the 2nd bay window I ran out onto the terrace, with a feeling that it might be a plane with a burning wing tank. From here, a cigar-shaped silhouette could be seen emitting the flame/light. The direction of flight was almost parallel to the block of flats, silent and at a constant height. At a position that could be over Copenhagen, it made a slight left turn and a flat dive, then straightened up and headed in its original direction at the height of the building&#39;s roofs (6 floors). Duration of observation, 15 to 20 seconds. A confusing and illogical experience.",

I&#39;m heading due east as I&#39;m looking at two low planets as usual. One approx. 10 degrees to the right of my direction of travel (probably Jupiter), and the other almost straight ahead. Both are located at an angle of approx. 10 degrees above the horizon. At It&#39;s 8:37 p.m. when, high up on the right, I spot a luminous object, which I at first assume is a third planet. It is located due south and at an angle of approx. 70 degrees above the horizon. After a few seconds I learn that it moves for approx. same direction as myself, i.e. east. The speed of the object corresponds to that of a passenger plane if it flew at an altitude of 10 kilometers. The distance cannot be judged, but just for reference. My own first explanation is that it is a satellite. The reason for this explanation is that it does not have flashing lights and the white light it does have is constant. But two things do not fit well with the theory of a satellite. First, it shone much brighter than the many satellites that I have seen over time. Its brightness was similar to the said planet 10 degrees to my right (as mentioned maybe Jupiter). Second, it must have either followed an unusually low trajectory and/or had an unusually high speed. I then immediately rule out that it was a plane, as there were no flashing lights, and that the constant light of the object seemed far too strong. The brightness of the object can perhaps be explained by the fact that the sun had set relatively shortly before (perhaps 35-40 minutes before). The twilight in the field of observation, combined with perhaps direct sunlight reflecting on the object, could perhaps make it shine extra strongly. It could thus be both. A very bright satellite, or a very bright plane where its flashes were drowned out by the light of the sun. The observation takes place for approx. 1.30 – 2.00 minutes until the object disappears behind some low-hanging clouds/cloud cover. At that time, it is located approx. at the height of the two planes (approx. 10 degrees above the horizon), and at a compass angle of approx. 5-10 degrees to the right of due east.",

I was so scared, I was the only person outside, everyone else was in cars, but apparently saw nothing as the rain poured down.

Just after the first observation, another 2 similar objects (lights) followed. Then I went to the bathroom to brush my teeth. I then went back to the kitchen to see if there were still any objects in the sky. Now two more objects (lights) were added, making a total of 8 lights (objects) in the sky flying around silently, (I opened the window to see if I could hear them) There was no sound from the objects at all. I observed them for a quarter of an hour until they finally disappeared approx. southeast from where I was with my roommate. I have taken 2 photos of the objects and, together with my partner, am willing to tell you more about my experience, should this be of interest to you.",

        "content": "First, some initial personal information. I am 43 years old (adult), rarely touch alcohol and have never taken drugs. So what I see in Haslev on 25/10 – 05 am. Approx. 00.50 I have to take note myself, as being real, and will claim the same to the outside world. I have also worked as a prison guard at Herstedvester — Denmark&#39;s only psychiatric institution. You are not allowed to do that unless your psyche is 100% in order. However, I predict that others will look at this report with a lot of skepticism, which is understandable in and of itself. I work the evening shift, and therefore go to bed relatively late. That night it was starry, and I stood in the yard and looked at the starry sky for a bit, after parking the car in the garage. Suddenly the farm (abandoned farm) is overrun by &quot;something&quot; in a SE direction and at a, I mean hellishly high speed. I can&#39;t determine the height, and therefore won&#39;t make a concrete guess at either the speed or the size. It is only visible for approx. 2-3 sec. Since the yard is three-legged, and one long one blocks the view in that direction. A description of the &quot;thing stone&quot;: Yes, when you watch television or listen to the radio, my obervation is actually rather boring, I have to admit that - but! it was a triangular, single-angled black surface with a number of dull glowing things along the edge - but these, however, clearly located within the surface itself, a 4 or 5 piece. along each edge. Unfortunately, due to the time (dark) and the viewing angle, I can only give a two-dimensional description. In addition, it was silent. Every now and then I want to say that it should have broken through the sound barrier with the resulting noise, but it didn&#39;t. There was no hint of engine noise either. Furthermore, it had some strange wiggling movements in a horizontal plane. Hard to describe in writing, but I&#39;ll try: It oscillated horizontally around its own vertical central axis, just as some cogwheels inside a clock also oscillate around their own central axis. I manage to see a &quot;tick and a tick&quot;, it flicks out and back again. Why? Don&#39;t know, you have to tell me, but it is my clear opinion that it was intended. It was not in any way unstable in its trajectory. That&#39;s what I saw, but since I&#39;m a trained boiler attendant and process operator it can&#39;t be avoided, the technician comes up in one, so I&#39;d like to attach a personal comment to the lights along the edge and to the distinctive movements. It was hardly a light in the usual sense, but probably a more integral part of the craft, probably part of the forward/buoyancy, as they pointed down and were located all the way around. The commute makes me think it must have been unmanned. There are hardly any living creatures that can withstand such movements over a long period of time — aliens or not. The G-force must have been terrible. Do I need to tell you that I went to bed an hour later than usual that night? I have always believed in the possibility of life elsewhere — now I don&#39;t believe anymore, I know!",

(I am a keen plane spotter and can say with the Fligtradar24 app that it was SK1260 from SAS). To my amazement I discover a smaller white round object, about the size of the plane&#39;s wing, flying parallel to the plane at maybe 500 meters distance and at what looks like the same height. After 6-9 seconds the object changes direction and flies directly south, so I lose sight of the object after 2-4 seconds due to our large tree in the garden. Unfortunately, it goes by so fast that my wife or parents-in-law don&#39;t get to observe it. I rush around to the other side of the tree, but then the object is gone. We have quite a few birds in the area that can fly high up, but the object here was flying straight - and flying at the same speed or faster than the plane. It didn&#39;t seem like the object changed speed.",

The detached house only reaches the height of the second floor, so there is an unobstructed view of lots of sky. They entered from the left, ie. from the inner city and moved to the right, i.e. against Valby. They flew in a formation that at first looked almost like Chariot (with a few that were outside of this distinct formation), but as they moved past the formation became more blurred. I don&#39;t know how many there were, but I&#39;m guessing 10 - 20. At first, the objects looked almost like small clouds with light in them, a few of which were larger and brighter than the others. As they moved past and the sunlight fell on them in a different way, they no longer looked quite so much like clouds with light in them, but became more &quot;shiny&quot; and &quot;metallic&quot;. There was otherwise a blue sky with no clouds, and almost no wind. It was all very significant - but also went quite quickly.",

        "content": "The object was observed completely by chance on 2 different evenings when I looked out of my kitchen window to look for luminous night clouds in the bright night sky to the north. The first time was in June 2012. Here the object lay still for approx. 30 seconds, after which it disappeared at a high speed for us humans above a high-lying lighter cloud cover to the north and was gone. I chose to suppress this, because yes, there was probably a natural explanation, and maybe I was just tired and saw.... Approx. On July 1, 2012, I looked again for luminous night clouds, and now something was hanging in the sky again in the same direction and height. This time the object was illuminated in colors similar to a sunset and it sparkled. I have subsequently thought that it must be the sun, which had indeed set on the ground, but which was still &quot;up&quot; at the height of the object. The object was relatively quiet, where a plane from the airport in Tirstrup would pass quickly. I mean it moved a few times in small jerks, like if you put a dot on your window and then move while looking at the dot on the window - so a quick little jerk. Now it had to be documented, so I had to get my camera, but the 10 seconds I was gone was enough for the object to have completely disappeared from the clear sky, and there were no signs of smoke/vapour in the sky, as after a emergency flares or a plane - ugh I would have liked to have seen it disappear at high speed and also had it on film. I am very interested in hearing if others have seen/observed the same object north of Aarhus approx. 35 degrees above the horizon during the mentioned period.",

At first I think it&#39;s satellites that happen to cross each other. The speed is faster than that of an airliner - a little faster than a fighter jet at high altitude. The lights are completely uniform and have an intensity that is slightly weaker than the surrounding stars. Before the lights meet, they straighten (turn each 45 degrees) and continue in a perfect pair run (they lie on a line perpendicular to the direction of movement) with a distance equal to half the distance between two stars in the &quot;handle&quot; of the Chariot. The lights continue in a north-westerly direction and begin to &quot;swing&quot; from and towards each other with an inner position which corresponds to the one mentioned above, and an outer position which is double - i.e. like between two stars in the Chariot&#39;s &quot;handle&quot;. This continues for approx. 30 sec. after which the rhythm is broken, they reduce the speed in the direction of movement to half, before picking up the speed again after 5 seconds. Then the lights keep an equal distance (corresponding to the outer position). The lights now begin a slow clockwise rotation, still in line. The mid-point of the line which can be drawn between the two lights follows the same speed and direction of movement as the lights turn, so that the south-west light is at the front in the direction of movement as they come so far towards the horizon that they fade and become blurred in the center of the city light.",

The distance was great, but I don&#39;t see any wings or tail rudder - it just seems elongated. It moves slower than I would expect from an airplane and emits a pulsating, possibly rotating, white light that seems to get stronger all the time. After observing the object for a good 30 seconds, I pass under some trees and lose sight of the object for no more than 10 seconds. When I have a clear view again, the object has completely disappeared into the blue sky. It is completely inexplicable to me, as the object has not been near a cloud or similar. There was no audible sound, which in itself is not surprising given the great distance.",

The objects were &quot;almost&quot; still, except when the three TVs from the sun came closer in formation, so slowly that I could not register it, and just as slowly the other two &quot;landed&quot;. Only today have we tried to download the images, and you can only see by manipulating the colors and contrast, otherwise the object disappears in the light.

        "content": "Saturday evening (May 17, 2014) I was standing on the terrace smoking a cigarette when I saw a very bright light in the sky to the south (I live in Egå, north of Aarhus). I stared at the phenomenon without saying a word, and for a moment I was convinced that it was an airliner in flames (although the light was clear, it was more like a fireball in color) headed for my house - size, speed and color of the phenomenon was fit for an airliner, except that absolutely no sound was to be heard anywhere, which puzzled me greatly. It was high up - we are used to seeing planes in the sky, which lose speed and speed because they have to land in tirstrup, but that is certainly not what we are talking about here. It was far too high up compared to the Tirstrup planes, and as mentioned, there was no sound of any kind either. Best as the panic was getting the better of me in relation to the fact that the &quot;passenger plane&quot; in flames/the object was heading towards us, and I had to evacuate the house for my wife and children if necessary, the object turned sharply to the left (as seen from my angle of view), towards mols/ebeltoft, after which it faded and disappeared soon after. And the turn the object took was sharp; it wasn&#39;t just a soft curve. And right after the turn it also faded away with tremendous speed. It went from being a violent large fireball in the sky to within 5 - 10 seconds (after the object changed course) to having largely disappeared from the sky. And it didn&#39;t come back again. I have no idea about the height of it, but I would guess that it was at least 2 kilometers high. as I said, I stood on the terrace and couldn&#39;t say much until it was all over, so I told my friend through the open garden door what I had experienced - he was visiting so we could see the speedway from Finland, but of course he asked me to check the quality of the wine we had consumed. Just after he asked me to pull myself together, another one of the same caliber as the one described first came - I called my friend, who came out on the terrace and fortunately was able to film the whole thing - albeit with his iPhone. But the scenario played out exactly as described above - same object, color, height, course change, fade out, etc. When he had filmed the whole thing, he was just as pumped as I was. And then it happened that number three came flying, which we also got on video - unfortunately again only with the iPhone. I say on the video that it is 23.13 when the last 2 &quot;arrives&quot;. I would guess that there have been approx. 4 - 5 minutes between the first to the next and the third. So, all in all, the whole thing is settled within approx. 10 minutes. We/I have searched like crazy to find an explanation for what we experienced on Saturday - and of course without success. I am on the verge of donating my firstborn to whoever can provide a plausible explanation. Not because I believe that there is a plausible explanation - for that it was simply too strange an experience when you take the size of the object, color (fire-coloured), speed, height, etc. into account - and that there were three of them in line, same behavior, change of cow etc. My wife will certainly also oppose the donation of our son. It was simply so crazy that I need an explanation for it - I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll get a good night&#39;s rest until it happens. And in general I&#39;m not a big UFO hunter or conspiracy theorist, but here the line to my skepticism has been crossed several times..... The reason why I choose to write in this forum is also that I naturally googled the phenomenon and found that others had the same experience on 17 May 2014. So it sounds easy to come up with a story 3 days later, but hopefully our videos can make up for this - if only so that the other observers of the same date might nod in recognition to the phenomenon based on the videos of the &quot;last two&quot; - we saw three, but really have no idea how many there might have been....",

It appeared to be far away and did not move for the half hour I observed it, but there was some red light occasionally for a longer time on the left side (not like an airplane). Also, there were some small white lights swarming around it (might resemble airplane lights), but no sound came from any of the objects. I could judge this when the Turks stopped playing. The triangular object appeared half the size of the moon, but appeared to be far away. I went in to see if there was anything special on the TV and when I came out there was nothing.

Suddenly I saw what I assumed was a satellite flying from north to south. As I watched it, without further ado, it changed direction to the west in a 90 degree turn. It flew much faster than a plane, which I conclude on the basis that it must have been high up, perhaps as far as 10-20 km. It was of approx. same brightness as a faint star, and of similar size. As I unfortunately didn&#39;t have my glasses on, I quickly slipped in after them, but it was no longer visible when I was out on the balcony again after just 10 seconds.

When the light phenomenon was close to Valby, the UFO turned from EAST 90° STEEP towards NORTH and disappeared in the distance. It was completely SILENT!!! So not a plane, - but maybe a light balloon (launched by humans ???) or something similar. An acquaintance of mine (associated with NASA) believed that it was a NASA phenomenon, ie a surveillance device that we are (without being told) exposed to. I doubt. Incidentally, the UFO moved COMPLETELY SILENTLY at an even speed and movement. I would estimate the size to be slightly smaller than a hot air balloon. I still wonder what it could be!

To the naked eye it seemed to change color (quickly changing) and I got another mate to watch. After we agreed it looked strange (while we had all the news with comet ISON in the back of our minds) I had a 3rd mate fetch a pair of binoculars. Through the binoculars the color shifting became much more apparent and I thought it looked like the colors were changing regularly. It could also look like there was a &quot;ring&quot; of changing color around the &quot;star&quot;, but this could also be because I couldn&#39;t hold the binoculars any longer. We discussed which direction it was coming from and agreed it must be in a southerly direction. It seemed that the &quot;star&quot; was moving slowly in the sky, after 1/2 hour it became cloudy. Got a picture taken with my iPhone camera and just looks like a smudged star. (due to zoom, etc.) I doubt it could be the comet ISON, and since I don&#39;t understand this sort of thing, I also doubt it is just a star that can sparkle in the mentioned colors (red /blue/white). All in all, I just became incredibly curious and therefore chose to write to you. Ps about 45 degrees (height above the horizon, I&#39;m in doubt) as well as whether it was due south, I didn&#39;t have a compass on me.",

But the wind is still, and the red ball is moving rather quickly, and at the same time I think I can hear a faint hum. The light changes to yellow and back to red, while continuing in the same direction and height to the west. I run in to get my binoculars (unfortunately my wife and daughter have just gone to bed). With the binoculars you can see the round light continue towards the horizon and occasionally change from red to yellow, still with a faint humming sound. No smoke like an emergency rocket would have given and probably much bigger and higher up.",

Another said it was a plane, but planes have beacons on their wings that flash every 3-4 seconds, it didn&#39;t observe it, and that it was moving at a high speed and totally silent from the time we observed it until it was right over our heads, and that there were no sounds either after it had passed. The item was approx. max. 1 kilometer up. The object was yellow in the center circle and around this circle were like 40 or more rotating circles of silver color. The object moved at a very high speed, a speed that far exceeded normal aircraft speed. Personally, I have never seen anything like this, but have always wanted to experience something like this, and I am glad that there were many witnesses to this, otherwise they would probably have said that I had sunstroke and had seen visions.",

        "content": "I report the memory below because I got a tip from my sister that a &quot;site&quot; on Google about a sighting in England in 1993 contained a description that sounded a bit like what I had experienced. Otherwise, I have not approached anyone other than a few friends about it - mostly because the memory is so strangely difficult to retrieve, but also because my observation seems &quot;science fiction-like&quot; and does not describe a UFO in the classic sense either - by that I mean a rotating, round thing with lots of light and very high speed. For some reason it is completely impossible for me to remember exactly when it took place. I&#39;m just certain that it was after 1998 and that it was before 2001. I haven&#39;t been able to reconstruct the time since, because my memory of the sighting fades within minutes, then I forget all about it in weeks or months before it hits me again that something strange happened. So the following is my observation: Probably in 2000 - either spring or early summer. It was evening and dark, but relatively warm. I am standing in the middle of the floor in our living room on the 2nd floor and am blinded by a white floodlight the size of a car&#39;s headlight coming from the west, where there is a clear view from the living room windows. We (my then 16/17 year old daughter, 11/12 year old son and myself) are very surprised and rush out onto the balcony – which also faces west. Here we see a very large vessel approaching very slowly – and flying very, very low. It&#39;s not loud, but has a very deep, unpleasant hum that I almost feel more than I hear it. The vessel is huge and completely dark gray against a black sky. It appears to be only 10-20 meters up and is at least a few hundred square meters, but seems flat. It is triangular, almost shaped like a fighter plane, only much larger. The underside is not smooth, but full of edges and shapes (actually like the underside of spaceships in movies). I don&#39;t remember there being any lights (this part of my memory is completely different from my daughter&#39;s?!) when it first came over us. It was approx. 10 seconds to pass over our heads, and then had come so far over that we would lose sight of it due to the roof of our block. We wanted to rush through the living room, out into the hallway and into the kitchen (usually about a 5 second run) which faces east to see where it flew to, but.... all I remember is that I reached the hall,—after that I know not what we did, or what we saw. On the whole, I don&#39;t remember at all what we did afterwards that night. I had no recollection of this entire experience until at least ½ or a full year later. We go for a walk with my sister and talk about everything, when suddenly - without warning - I remember something about a huge vessel that the children and I had seen. I&#39;m thinking like crazy about what it was I saw. I tell my sister that I suddenly remember seeing something, and I call my children who are running some distance away and ask them if they don&#39;t remember some strange craft we saw a long time ago. They both look a little surprised, but after a few seconds, I can see that something is coming to their mind. They think a lot and are a little hesitant, as if it is very difficult for them to hold on to the memory, but after a few more seconds they begin to tell - a little in leaps and bounds and in each other&#39;s mouths - about the same experience. But all three of us find it very difficult to recall the experience. And every time we&#39;ve talked about it, we forget it again within minutes, and don&#39;t think about it again until weeks or months later. It is as if the memory &quot;will not be remembered&quot; - as if there is a filter that is almost impossible to penetrate. And none of us still remembers what happened when we wanted to go out to see the vessel on the east side...none of us remembers anything else from that night!",

        "content": "It is completely cloudless. Obliquely up to the right, probably at a high altitude, what I first think is a satellite is observed, however, a little faster. It shines like a big star with the same light quality, i.e. approximately white and flies in a straight line. I know a great deal about airplanes and my instinctive interest was immediately piqued. This was unusual. After approx. After 10 seconds, the light suddenly goes out like a slow-extinguishing light bulb, and only a small luminous horizontal line remains. Which then vanishes before my eyes. The speed was nowhere near a meteorite. The observation is linked to an observation I made in 1978 over Lyngby of two objects with exactly the same quality of light, which in turn performed aerial acrobatics, which at that time, and is not possible today in a human-made machine. The then observation was made at approx. 17 on a winter&#39;s day from Lyngby Station Square. Two lights came, like two planes side by side, flying from the right at great speed. They made an approx. 110 degree turn and then flew from left to right as they performed, at high speed, some local very sharp changes of direction in the direction of flight before flying steeply and very quickly upward literally into space. It was because of this very telling observation in 1978 that the luminous white point-shaped object immediately piqued my interest last night.",

        "content": "Today there was a bicycle race in Vejle on something called Søndermarken. The cycling team usually cycle past in this area where I live. I didn&#39;t want to see it, so I contented myself with looking out of my bedroom window and watching the beautiful blue sky, and I could hear that there was full documentation around the bike race. A helicopter came into view and moved in the direction where the bike race was happening. They might be filming the race or watching traffic and things like that. Suddenly I see two lenticular luminous objects moving across the sky, over the parking lot which is outside my bedroom. The objects were silent and shiny, slightly dazzling. They kept pace with each other all the time, sometimes circling each other, but they never parted. They came from the south, i.e. from the direction of around the place where there was a bicycle race. They moved over the forest that I am next door to, in a northerly direction, and down towards the city (I live a little high up and away from the city itself). I&#39;m all excited and call my mom who lives down town and tell her what I&#39;ve seen. About five minutes later, I see a single sphere, perfectly round and chalk white, moving (floating almost) in the same direction, just a little further away. Almost immediately after, a green military helicopter arrives, which has obviously lost interest in the bike race, and it moves in the direction of the place where I saw the bullet. A few minutes later I see something moving very high up in the clouds, in a northerly direction, and it&#39;s a gray and metallic ball, and I assume it must have been big as I see it so clearly and so high up , as it is. My mother calls and tells me that the military helicopter has reached the town where there is no bike race, and I tell her about the other bullets I saw and that the helicopter may be chasing them. Soon after, I see the last bullet, which is close and very clear. It moves quietly across the parking lot, again from the south and again to the north. Silent. It is perfectly round and very white. I am fully up to speed and keep my mother up to date. Nothing more happened then, it was over. I&#39;m not very good with heights and distances and can&#39;t provide satisfactory data about those things, but all this happened between about 4 and 5 pm this afternoon. Maybe under half an hour. I didn&#39;t keep an eye on the time, I just observed and was completely up to speed. I have a video camera and I have decided to have it ready in case more of these orbs/objects appear. It must be said that I have seen similar objects many times in my life, also in my area, day and night, but have never been prepared and therefore never been able to e.g. to film them or take pictures of them. There must have been others who must have seen some of these balls/objects today, but it can be thought that most of them probably focused on the bike race. There may be few witnesses who dare not report it. I know what I saw today was very unusual, they were neither drones nor balloons, they were intelligently controlled, and the two lenticular objects I first saw behaved intelligently. And when the military helicopter suddenly moves away from the bike race and towards one of the balls, there must have been something unusual going on.",

At first we don&#39;t think much about it, apart from the fact that it&#39;s the only light you can see in the sky, but when it suddenly changes to bluish light, it&#39;s a bit mysterious, but you think drone or other man-made phenomenon. It is only when the object suddenly falls very quickly towards the ground, hovering approx. 10 degrees to the north and disappears to the southwest for approx. 220 degrees until it is under the roof. The speed at which this maneuver was accomplished surpasses anything I&#39;ve seen from even fast drones and the like. We&#39;re talking maybe 2-3 seconds for a fall that looks like many 100 meters (maybe km, it was hard to tell how far it was horizontally) followed by the horizontal movement to the southwest until it was out out of sight. Took some pictures and videos, unfortunately not as it moved away and the quality is not great as it was taken with an older HTC phone at night, but will try to email them anyway. Also made a daylight sketch of the process. Hope you have a qualified guess as to what size the cave was.",

        "content": "I was sitting with a guest in our living room when our guest spotted something in the sky that caught her attention. I looked out and could see a very bright star, low over the horizon. Since it was a relatively bright evening, with a nearly full moon, it was difficult to see other stars, making the bright spot we saw appear to be an anomaly. We observed the spot for maybe 5-7 minutes and it varied in brightness, sometimes flashing, other times slowly pulsating. Our guest experienced it as if there were more than one point, very close to each other. A bright bright spot, with a faint spot just above, and one just below. I didn&#39;t have the same experience but thought there was only one point. I experienced it as if the point was far away, at least several kilometers, maybe 10 or more. My first thought was that it might be an aircraft, possibly on its way in for landing at Bornholm Airport, but since it was not moving relative to the ground, I had no theory as to what the point was. When the first 5-7 minutes had passed, something very unusual happened. Another point, somewhat smaller, appeared in the sky, somewhat below and to the right of the first point, and it quickly moved in a straight line up towards the first point and struck it, causing both points to disappear. Just as the smaller dot (resembling a New Year&#39;s rocket in a dark sky before it explodes) hit the first dot, the brightness increased somewhat before it all disappeared. There was no visible explosion or the like. After a few minutes there was again a point in the sky, in the same place. It all repeated in the same way with the difference that the dot did not disappear when the smaller dot hit it. After a few more minutes, the spot disappeared after slowly losing its brightness. At that time I called my colleague in the air traffic control tower at Bornholm Airport to ask him if he might have any information about the phenomenon. He had not seen the point, but looked to the east, and then the point was back in the sky again, and he could see it too. The firing ranges east of Bornholm, ES D 138 and ES D 139, were not active, according to the information he had available. He had a plane coming in for landing from the west and we ended our conversation. Shortly thereafter, the dot was hit a third time by the smaller dot that again suddenly became visible in the sky, below and to the right of the first dot, and this time both dots disappeared again on impact. I immediately called my colleague, but unfortunately he had been talking to the arriving plane and had therefore not seen the collision. After some time the first point returned again, in the same place. This time we did not observe any collision, but the point eventually disappeared in the same way as the second time, it slowly lost its brightness and disappeared. This last time our guest observed from the guest room on the first floor and I from the living room. After the fourth time, clouds began to move in from the west, and it was no longer possible to see if there were any more points of light or collisions.",

It looked like something had been there for days, the grass was pressed down and withered. There was nothing to see on 1 January. The rings were scattered over the lawn, but not in any pattern and only where there was space above - not under the trees. Has there been a hit by mini-vessels, or what could it be? Too bad no one saw how they came to be.",

I looked at it for several minutes, when for a moment it seemed to split into two separate lights. I see planes take off here daily from Kastrup. I have also traveled a lot by plane myself. It was NOT a plane, and it wasn&#39;t a helicopter, because I would have been able to hear that. Also, I ended up seeing the unfamiliar light so high up that there is no helicopter up there. I would estimate that it rose 60 degrees or more upwards and 40-50 degrees to the north. I&#39;ve never seen anything strange without an explanation before, and I&#39;m just having a really hard time finding a logical explanation for this.

This is something I have done often, as there is a large golf course right next door which is completely quiet in the evening. But unfortunately I don&#39;t get all the way down there this evening because I observe two orange red lights out in the sky far out on the horizon in the direction of the golf course. They fly from right to left at a leisurely pace. The upper one is a bit ahead of the lower one, but they fly completely in sync. Distances between them are perhaps a clenched fist. I now stop and look at the lights seriously and notice that there are no sounds and the light is constant. And in the same second that I think that this seems a little mysterious, the upper light goes out, and it never comes back. But the lower one continues at the same calm pace, but suddenly begins to fade its light until it disappears completely. It all only takes one to two minutes, but am 100% sure that I have witnessed something I have never seen before. It should also be said that I grew up right next to Værløse Airport and have seen all kinds of civil and military planes and helicopters since childhood. The constant light and the pace they kept, plus the fact that they flew in sync, arouses my wonder. What is a fist to me must be several kilometers away to them, which is why I am still very amazed that they were able to fly completely in sync. It was as if they were one and the same organism. Also never before seen a plane with that constant orange-red color not to mention it dimmed down like it had a dimmer switch attached. I&#39;m sorry that I didn&#39;t make it all the way to the golf course in total darkness, but unfortunately it&#39;s not something you choose for yourself.",

When, as so often before, I just look up at the sky out of the window, I spot a strong light in the night sky to the southwest. At first I think it is a plane, but soon I can see that it is coming closer and is shaped like a huge shining diamond, with the pointed end at the bottom. The object radiated bright yellow streaks of light all around, almost like a sparkler, but the light was not pulsating. It was at 01.03, the street lights had just been switched off, there were no stars or moon to be seen, it was completely windless with a few degrees of frost, the ground covered in snow. There was no sound, everything was completely silent. I managed to take a photo, but due to the darkness, long shutter time on the camera, and the speed of the object, which was faster than a plane, it was almost like a picture of lightning, a shame because it can&#39;t be used for anything, can it? It all lasted approx. 5 minutes, luckily I woke my wife up so she could see it too, otherwise she&#39;d think I&#39;d gone crazy. The object, when closest, was slightly larger than a clasped hand in an outstretched arm. I would think it flew between Ruds Vedby and Dianalund, it seemed to disappear beyond Brandstrup/Orebo/Vedde with direction approx. Holbæk. It would be fun to hear if others have seen the phenomenon. I think there is more between heaven and earth than we imagine.",

Thought for the first second that it might be light from show projectors, but quickly ruled it out (Who would turn something like that on on a Monday night anyway?). Have seen this kind of thing time and time again, and it looks completely different. Partly you can see the rays, partly it is limited how large a piece of the sky they cover, partly you see the light as misty blobs of a certain size, and partly the light is reflected against blobs of clouds. It doesn&#39;t disappear behind them like these did. It was about independently bright light sources - not reflected light. Airplanes, drones etc. can also be excluded, because it is not possible for something like that to move so quickly over such a large area. Besides, drones probably don&#39;t go higher than the clouds either. The observation was made by the undersigned and my son, whom I summoned. We observed it for approx. 45 minutes, however interrupted by the fact that at one point a plane passed in the area. During that time, the objects disappeared, only to return when it had passed. In between, the objects streaked rapidly due east, across the observation site, and were grounded out of our sight for a time, then returned after a moment and again traveled around as described in the western sky. Due to increasing cloud cover, we could at approx. 03:15 do not see them anymore, and therefore do not know if the phenomenon has continued any longer. The phenomenon did not repeat itself last night (8-8). Would love to hear if others have observed it and perhaps have a good explanation for it. I&#39;m a bit skeptical about the little green men thing.",

Then they disappear and then they come back again. The size is hard to describe. But both look like a completely bright tube with enormous speed. Nothing resembling a plane or helicopter. It is completely dark, but they appear reasonably clear at a place that is slightly less dark on the horizon. They are definitely not planets.

She suggested we go out. When we got out it was almost in front of us in the sky followed by more. There were 6 flying things in total. They moved at the same pace as an airplane, but completely silently. When No. 2 was ahead of us, No. 2 and No. 4 began to spin violently around themselves while still moving forward at the same pace. Both machines turned off their lights as they began to spin around, where I could make out a silhouette of the nearest machine. It was almost like holding up a deep plate; around and with something underneath. The light from the machines was very strong, just as the whole machine was in light and with a strength like a star. It sounds very incredible. If I heard it from others, I wouldn&#39;t believe it, but that&#39;s what I saw. I&#39;ve never seen anything even remotely similar to this before.

When I looked, there was a luminous ball the size of a 50 øre with strong speed. It stood still in the air for a few seconds and disappeared incredibly quickly. A bit like a giant comet. As the weather was very windy I couldn&#39;t get it to fit a white flare or anything that would risk flying out in that weather and not so low in the sky. Since then I have remembered that in the summer of 1997 a local farmer found a crop circle in that direction. There was something about it in the local paper. I normally live in the US and am not a big UFOist, but I saw a feature about SUFOI on the news on TV today and found your website.",

I experience a luminous ball in blue/green shades, with a small tail on the right side in luminous white colors, the luminous tail can be ½ to a full meter in length. My colleague, who sits on the right side of the car, experiences an orange glowing ball that is suddenly there and immediately disappears again - she does not think there is a &quot;tail&quot;. We pull to the side to look around, it is dark everywhere, there are no lights in any houses over the fields, the sky is almost starry, there is a full moon, with a very thin transparent cloud layer. It&#39;s not fireworks, it certainly doesn&#39;t look like shooting stars that we so often see in the night watch, but what is it?

KB drives every evening on the same small road to get to a farm. KB has no idea what&#39;s wrong, as the car stalls. He now holds a watering hole on the left and open field on the right. A hedge runs from the water hole to the road. It is along this fence that KB now sees a very strong beam of light directed at the car. The light is white and pulsating. He notices that there is no sound to be heard. You have to remember, it&#39;s 1958, when at least a helicopter could be heard!! The point is close to Skrydstrup Airport, so an aircraft of some kind could not be unthinkable! The light moves along the fence as if it were a natural obstacle. It makes movements as if it is &quot;searching&quot;. It stops in the middle of the road and moves over KB&#39;s car. It is now clear that it is a massive object of 25-30 meters in diameter. Not something I think you have in Skrydstrup! It is still completely still, and a few seconds later the object slides away with great speed. - To the south. The object is constantly 10-15 meters above the ground. The car starts again, KB rushes home to the farm and tells it. He was a very down-to-earth man who did not let himself be shaken, and was quite skeptical. But in the time after, he was clearly affected by the incident. He finds it very difficult to find words that can explain his experience, only when he hears the term UFO several days later is he himself convinced!!",

Before bed we stood outside on our terrace and enjoyed the cool evening breeze. Suddenly two clear beams of light came at a vertical angle from the sky and shone where we were standing, it lasted for 3-4 seconds. We naturally looked up, but there was nothing to see or hear! Could it have been a shooting star or similar. It was a very strange experience.",

I can best describe it as a shooting star or the burning up of a small meteorite. A light with the power of a bright star suddenly appeared, continued like a small shooting star, but without a tail at first. This luminous moving object does not look like it is particularly high up, maybe a few kilometers. It &quot;falls&quot; obliquely downwards in an easterly direction, with a dip of perhaps 30-35 degrees in relation to the horizon. After 1-2 seconds it starts to burn up, like a New Year&#39;s rocket with a tail. It retains its size as a powerful star and brightness, which however diminishes as it &quot;burns up&quot; in the sky. After that, it disappears out of sight because it is no longer warm enough to be seen. The whole incident takes between 3-5 seconds and happens while I&#39;m driving on the freeway. FYI the sky is cloudless, maybe only on the lowest part of the horizon and the moon is almost full in the opposite direction (west).",

Then it appears to change direction and move in a horizontal line. Right away, it&#39;s as if something either falls off the ball or is shot out of it. It falls slowly in an arc to start with and then descends slowly. It happens 1 time, but the third time it shoots something out it doesn&#39;t take long, then the large object falls a little faster than the 3 small ball in an arc and then falls at the same pace as the ball no. 3 and then disappears. Very puzzled as to what it could be. It was moving faster than a plane ... After thinking about it for a bit, I got the idea that maybe it could have been a fighter plane, but after that the object must have collided with the third thing it shot out. I don&#39;t want to think it could be a fighter jet that shot out flares. We wondered right with me and my friend.",

The party took place indoors, but at one point he got hot and went outside, where he found a soccer ball, which he played against a wall. At one point the ball fell down the driveway and one of the other children ran down to retrieve it. She called him to come and see something strange: He describes what they saw as a craft that looked like something out of a Star Wars movie. It was green on the underside. A strange sound came from the vessel - he could not describe it - had never heard anything like it. The craft moved back and forth over the site as if searching for something - at one point it rose vertically into the sky and disappeared. Why do I believe the story? There were 2 of them who saw the incident. It was by chance that we came to talk about it - no sensationalism about the story. I asked him more about the blade as to whether it could be a plane or a helicopter or possibly a remote controlled UFO, but that is out of the question. Children&#39;s imagination - no, I don&#39;t think so here, the situation arose spontaneously and the whole story was played down as if it was nothing special. The children had merely noted what they saw and were not afraid.",

It was just below Sirius at a speed of what a normal jet has, so I took my binoculars, which are 7*50, and looked a little closer at it. But I couldn&#39;t see anything as the light was too bright (I also tried with my telescope but couldn&#39;t catch it). I now noticed that it was starting to change course and speed. I know a fair amount about airplanes and I know it wasn&#39;t a landing light from an airplane. My thought that it was a satellite changed when the UFO began to slow down and stop once in a while. It then did that for a while, and then the light began to fade and finally disappear completely. As I am very interested in the subject, I immediately went to your website and wrote a report. I know it wasn&#39;t a comet because it flew too slowly for that, and a comet doesn&#39;t slow down and then stop for a while either. It can hardly be a laser or other kind of spotlight, because it was a Thursday evening. I have no scientific explanation for it.",

Unfortunately, I have not had the pleasure of experiencing this myself, but since I could never imagine my parents telling lies, I have become extremely curious about this. I have searched for it on Google and found on your website an account of a similar phenomenon, however approx. 8-10 years earlier than my parents&#39; account, which was in the late 70s. It concerns something they saw when they lived in Gråsten. They mention a green glowing object that flew across the sky at high speed (3-4 seconds) from the time they could see it until it was gone again. They explain it as flying from east to west, and the green light being the size of a round bale (so it appeared to them to be quite close - less than 500m). They describe it as being silent and fast. They mention that the next day it was in the newspapers that there had been intense UFO activity in the area - it could also be interesting to get your hands on these ads!? What I found on your website is below: Reports 1/4-30/6 2010 as 6300 Gråsten, but as said being approx. 8-10 years before my parents&#39; experience. Thus, I am now very curious about whether you have other information or reports - or possibly a more detailed explanation of this phenomenon?",

        "content": "Saturday 7 August in the evening at 22.35, we sat with some friends on our terrace in Høje Tåstrup near Copenhagen. Best as we sat and talked about loose and firm, the undersigned noticed something, which I first thought was one of the usual planes on approach to Kastrup Airport. It was a bright light, like the landing lights of an airplane during take-off or approach, moving from northwest to southeast. I am a plane enthusiast, so I always keep a watchful eye when the planes come close above us. But suddenly I noticed another light behind the first object and thought it was strange that two planes on the same approach route were so close to each other. I then told the others at the table that there is something wrong here and everyone now looked up and saw the same thing as me. The objects moved quite slowly, almost like an aircraft on approach, but completely silent. The light grew brighter and brighter, and the objects drew closer to each other. When they were closest to us, one object began to pick up a bit of speed and went higher, while the other continued out on the horizon to the southeast and quickly disappeared. The other could be seen for a while as it quickly disappeared up into the sky. The objects were moving so slowly to begin with that we were able to pick up the camera and took a few photos that are not particularly good. But you can see the balls of light together in one photo. The second shows only one. We are very surprised that it was so local that others have not noticed them. The weather was a bit hazy, but the lights were apparently under the cloud cover. It wasn&#39;t ball lightning or shooting stars. Of course, we are not aware of what it was.",

At first we thought it was a plane or a helicopter, but we decided to stop at a rest area to have a closer look. When we got out, we could see an almost triangular object 100-200 meters above us, which was illuminated along the sides. There was a faint noise - almost humming like from a vacuum cleaner. We agreed that there was no way this could be either a plane or a helicopter. The object remained suspended in the air for a few minutes, after which it slowly moved south.",

Later I see a coming rising from n, which also suddenly disappears. A few minutes later, another one comes from nø and sends towards nw. At 7 when I wake up I see a single flying from nv which disappears quickly. A few seconds later, I suddenly see a cluster of 6-8 pieces, which disappear just as quickly as the first one. Shortly after they appear again, this time they come from all directions, but mostly from nv. Calling a friend who is a neighbor where I live and asking her to look out the window. She sees the same thing as me. Now they fly into each other, while approx. 2 from nø towards nw, but they continue the direction towards nw in steady motion. One or two look like they&#39;re flapping their wings like birds, but no matter which way they turn, I can see them all the time. Some come from n and seem to come from higher up than the others. At this point it looks like there are around 15-20 pieces. I usually see birds coming flying from about s, but when they get to where they are shining, I can no longer see them. At approx. At 7.30 they are completely gone. Saw on page 23 that it could be reminiscent of a bird phenomenon, but what surprises me is that I see it at 11.45 p.m., where a few disappear quickly, and again at 7-7.30. And that it was only on some that I could see wings and not others..... Degrees and direction are a guess, as I don&#39;t quite have a handle on it.",

I have a rough picture in my head of the starry sky and quickly agreed with myself that there should not be two bright stars nearly level with Vega in this location. I also ruled out planets, and as I pondered this and considered taking a photo, the two lights disappeared simultaneously for 15 seconds with erratic light variation, as if clouds were drifting in ahead, but there were no clouds in the sky. At this point it dawned on me with considerable hair-raising that these were neither stars nor satellites nor comets, but two UFOs. The lights were exactly vertically above each other at a distance corresponding to well over half the distance from Altair to Altair&#39;s nearest flanking star. The observation lasted approx. 2 minutes and the lights didn&#39;t move. It took over an hour to get the little hairs to lay down again, but maybe there is a down-to-earth explanation? Subsequently, I have come to the conclusion that the lights have been on for approx. in the position R 23h50m D 9 degrees 21 minutes corresponding to the star 80 Peg.",

Held to the side and stood out of the carriage. The object passed &quot;over my head&quot; relatively slowly and completely silently, although it appeared to be very large. Never seen or experienced anything like it before or since, and have been very reluctant to tell anyone else about the phenomenon - until I surfed past your site and read about the &quot;Belgian phenomena&quot; - although the lights here are different. Have evaluated all possible and impossible theories about what kind of aircraft it could be. The incident happened a few months before the start of the Gulf War (where the F-117 was introduced) and I remember wondering if it might have been such a model on &quot;test flight&quot; from a German base - but as I said the object was very large in the field of vision, flew slowly and at the same time was totally silent - and led the mentioned 9 permanently glowing &quot;navigation&quot; lights - so I personally have no doubt that it could not have been.",

The dog was sleeping, but suddenly he became restless, barked and seemed scared, got up and ran inside and hid under the table. My mom followed to find out what was wrong with the dog - and that&#39;s when I saw the 4 bullets. They glowed with a bluish fluorescent light, in the same way as embers in a fire that has been burning for a long time and is about to burn out - the fire in red colors, and these balls in blue. I cried out, but when my mother came back out, it was over. Have thought about it many times since - orbs, the strange light and the dog&#39;s behavior... Thought about it again when a few of your people were on TV recently.",

        "content": "When the object is observed, I first think it is a shooting star and tell my son to look, but a split second later I change my mind because the light is not white and the body is large, but dimly lit and with a red/ orange area in the middle. Therefore, I think it is a satellite, but the body moves very quickly of a satellite, so I wonder. When the body then a second later makes an unnaturally sharp turn at the violent speed that the body had, I have to give up. I often see shooting stars, airplanes and satellites. Had the body just flown in the same straight path, I would still have wondered what it was, but would not have written to you. But this body was either very large, or flew at a low altitude completely silently, so it was not powered by an internal combustion engine, at least not as we know it. It was a circular body, with a not very bright outline and with an orange-red center, which was approx. 1/4 of the diameter, and it wasn&#39;t particularly lit either. A shooting star or a satellite shines much more powerfully and clearly. The body did not blink, the lights were constant and dim. The movement of the body in the sky was unnatural. The speed was very high, approx. 45° in 3-4 sec. but the height was difficult to determine, so the speed cannot be immediately calculated. The body filled much more of the sky than an airplane, maybe like an airliner at an altitude of 2-3 km, but it was not an airplane. The shape was circular. The body makes a left turn about its direction of motion and crosses its own previous direction of flight at an angle of approx. 90° and disappears. I&#39;ve seen cones of light make similar rapid movements in the sky before, and that would be my only natural explanation. But this was not a light cone, the body was actually very dimly lit and there was no light cone or light trail from the movement. The movement was so fast and the turn was made at a speed that cannot be made by an airplane, it is out of the question.",

        "content": "My name is X. I am 14 years old and from Koldingen. My best friend&#39;s name is Y. She lives on a farm in Z, with many fields around. We are often together, but the last time we were together, something quite unusual happened. We also often spend the night together, and in the summer we are used to lying out on the trampoline and sleeping. We have done that to both her and me. Then we cover the trampoline with blankets, blankets and pillows, and lie down looking at the stars and talking together until we fall asleep. It&#39;s summer vacation, and today is Monday 28 June 2010, and the last time we spent the night together was Saturday to Sunday 26-27. We had planned to sleep on the trampoline and we had taken her one dog out. The oldest of the dogs is a small faithful Danish-Swedish farm dog. And the youngest, a playful Labrador, was not allowed to go out. It was a full moon that night. When we were lying out on the trampoline, we talked about how it couldn&#39;t be right that our planet, Earth, was the only planet with life out of all the planets in the universe. Suddenly we both look to the right, where an object that is not an airplane is flying. It is round and square at the same time. It&#39;s sort of a square with very round edges, but still round on the sides. It looks a bit like a deep plate, with a flat plate on top. It has a green fluorescent tube all the way around the side, and some red fluorescent tubes at the bottom of the sides. It hums a strange sound, and lights up a lot. We quickly whip up a feeling that it&#39;s a UFO, because it couldn&#39;t possibly be an airplane, since it was flying too far down, and didn&#39;t have the same shape as an airplane, or anything we&#39;d seen before for that matter. It must have been around 1 in the morning at that time. We were both pretty sure it was a UFO, and therefore wanted to take a picture of it with a mobile phone. But when we tried it and looked at the picture, we couldn&#39;t see the UFO in the picture. It flew away over/past the yard. We lie and talk about it, and behaves unusually, locking its gaze in the direction of the Moon, where the UFO came from. About 15-20 minutes later, Y suddenly says: &quot;went out into the field&quot;! AND I look out there. Out in the field I see two smaller objects, flying at a height of about 4 meters above the field, and they were quite a bit smaller than the first one. They are slightly more elongated and round, and do not have the same round square edges. They were more round and elongated, and they didn&#39;t have the same green light around the edge. Instead, they had three glowing red circles that glowed off each other. That is that they shone in turn. First the first one, and when it stopped blinking after one time, the next one took over, which blinked once, and finally it was the last one that blinked once. The light lasted for approximately 1 second at a time. Of the last two small UFOs, one was approximately 200 meters from us, and the other approximately 400-500 meters from us. They flew considerably lower than the first one. The first probably flew about 10-15 meters above the ground. They all came from the direction of the moon. The last two flew, they began to fly lower and lower towards the field and we were afraid that they would land, but when they were about 1.5-2 meters above the field, they did not fly up obliquely, but directly up in the air about 4 meters, and then straight again, and disappeared behind the yard. We were really scared because we were convinced that it didn&#39;t look like anything we&#39;d seen before, or anything man-made. When it had disappeared over the yard, there must have been 3 bangs in a way. They cannot be described as bangs, but more like horses galloping over the cobblestones. We then ran inside because we felt unsafe. It was around 1.30 in the night at that time. When we ran in, the dogs got quite nervous and bleated and barked. We woke up her mother, who got up and looked out the door, where one of the dogs ran out. It ran to the opening into the courtyard, from which came a bright light. It was difficult to get it back in, but we succeeded in the end. Carried the little dog in her arms, and it was very afraid. We ended up having to sleep inside.",

There we can see a very powerful yellow/orange object flying slowly and steadily from southwest to northeast over Næstved town. Further out on the horizon we can see two more objects of the same color and speed coming towards us. As the objects pass us, I can make out a very irregular flash behind the strong light. There is no sound at all. It is difficult to assume how high they have flown. It seems at first glance that they are the same height judging by their sizes. In addition, they fly under the cloud layer that is valid at the time. The speed is estimated to be the same as in a single-engine propeller machine. Unfortunately, we do not have the best view in the direction in which they disappear, as our terrace is covered.",

I went out on the terrace to observe the phenomenon and then saw that it was followed by 2 similar objects of the same brightness. If one can talk about extent or shape, it must be roughly said to be more horizontally oval than circular. It is difficult to describe when it emits such a powerful light. I called to my wife of 48 years and daughter of 11 years, and together we stood and observed the 3 brightly shining phenomena that came in from the Baltic Sea due east, and straight ahead they all made a 70 degree turn in the same curve to the south. After that they continued until they disappeared behind trees or the horizon if you will. The speed is difficult to estimate, but the height is assumed to be 500 meters max. Speed 3-4 times that of a regular private plane. I myself have flown OY-RPU, a 4-seater Piper Cherokee, so I think the assessment of altitude and speed is very safe. There was no sound or any kind of audible movement. Where we live is &quot;dead quiet&quot;, as it is a summer house area (Marielyst centre) with very few permanent residents. All 3 objects had the same curve and brightness, and the direction was not affected by gravity, which is why they must have had their own power for determining speed and direction. The velocity appears constant and linear from the east. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t get to take pictures, but expect to be able to read about it in the local paper tomorrow, as several people must have seen the same sighting.",

They streaked across the sky at a low altitude (a few hundred meters directly above me), with a faintly luminous outline (a bit like a window shape) without making a sound. The objects had a considerable size, and were probably approximately 20-40 meters diagonally. I watched them cross the arc of the sky from horizon to horizon above me. I only looked up when a passenger plane came flying from south-east to north-west, and by the way it was a beautiful and very starry evening. The objects crossed the path of the airliner from southeast to northwest (the plane was coming from south to north). I was standing in the garden by my gate, which I had just closed, but the surveillance camera only recorded my reaction in the seconds after the objects passed (which is a bit unusual, since the camera often starts as soon as it sees movement). It was fun! Not creepy or scary, just weird. Wildly strange. That something big can move so fast, fly so low and be silent is incomprehensible. In addition, one of the three objects drastically changed formation in an almost zig-zag turn in front of the other two, just as they passed over me. My very first thought was fighter jets as they came fast, low and in formation. But there was absolutely NO sound when they had passed... That was the strangest thing about the experience. I have worked approx. 3.5 years as an engineer in the air force (2016-2019, transport and inspection aircraft), but never heard of or seen anything like it. I immediately looked at Flightradar24, but only saw the airliner on the radar display. It was only in the area around Frederikssund. Do you have other reports from the same short period of time?",

The scenario is completely identical to my observation on February 6: At first glance, the object looks like the Star of Bethlehem, as we know it from movies and stories. Big, clear and sparkling. The difference between the Star of Bethlehem and the object I see is that the object moves slowly and in a straight and horizontal line from west to north/northeast. Sometimes the object stops and stands still, after which it moves a little up and down, and flies back a little. I can&#39;t judge how far away the object is - or how fast it&#39;s flying? However, I can report that the object has moved a full arm&#39;s length in 1 hour. The object has a very clear and strong white color which occasionally changes (flashes) to cobalt blue. Unfortunately, I do not have the right equipment to record my observations (my I-phone cannot focus so sharply. I have tried, both with video and pictures. If you have the opportunity and if you are interested in seeing it repeatedly phenomenon, please contact me by email. The object is clearly visible every late evening from 11:30 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. in the same orbit and on the same course. I am quite aware that airplanes and satellites can sometimes be observed far, far up in the night sky , but neither planes nor the satellites move up and down, or back and forth. So I am convinced that it is something completely different (but what??) Finally, it should be mentioned that the observations were made by 2 - sometimes 3 people. So I&#39;m not crazy.",

I&#39;m sitting in my living room watching TV when out of the living room window I see what I assume is a parachute flare or flare. Just tonight our curtains are not drawn for what they usually are. The light comes from a westerly direction and appears to be rising from behind a small group of trees, approx. 250 meters from our house. I wonder, however, that the light seems to narrow our house, and not rise vertically. The object appears to be nearly round, bright orange in the center, without any precise demarcation of the edges. The edges were placidly flickering like a flame. I get up and open the patio door in the living room to listen, but hear nothing. The family, my wife and 2 daughters, come to see the object as well. They don&#39;t hear anything either. I ask them to get a camera, which they don&#39;t understand. However, my youngest daughter takes a picture with her phone from the west side of our house, towards the church, north. At that point the object is north of us, and I estimate that it is no more than 50 - 70 meters up, although very uncertain, just as the size is difficult to judge. From when we observe it until it reaches the northern point, where it passes the longitude of our house, it takes a little over 1 minute. Since I can no longer see it from our west-facing terrace, I go out on the east side of our house and see that the object continues to the east. I think that my parents, who live in Ulkebøl (approx. 7 km as the crow flies), must lie on the line that the object follows. I call and ask them to go out to see if they can observe the object, but they see nothing. Approx. 4 minutes after the object appeared, it disappeared out of the field of vision, following the described line. The movement was very constant, and not accelerating, and completely silent. The likeness of a very slowly horizontally moving flare, which however did not change height.",

But I have not been able to reproduce this effect. I have no idea what it was we saw. There was no sound about it, so if they were planes, they must have been very high up. If it was a plane, then the light might be reflections from the sun, since it is not that long after sunset. And the sun might well be shining on planes that were a few kilometers up. However, the size of the lights was so large that I somewhat doubt this. The video camera is a Panasonic NV-GC280, which has a 3.0-30 mm Leica optic. (This corresponds to an SLR with 42-430mm optics). I would very much like to clarify what it was we saw.",

Observed initially at 90 degrees and possibly only 1 km over land. The speed seems to change in displacements and the direction is continuously changed in small degrees several times, until either the distance itself or the given deviation from the sun&#39;s light diminishes its marking on the night sky, and then in a 20-25gr. above the horizon clearly changes course during an angular angled maneuver and moves north several/many kilometers west of Horsens. In any case, the object could not be compared to ordinary celestial phenomena and also seems to have several smaller light sources (as it now appeared at the uncertain distance/height). Seen something similar twice before in my life but never reported. Thinking it&#39;s important we remember to write them down so we don&#39;t go and brush them off like it didn&#39;t happen.",

All of a sudden, out of the upper window (slatted windows) I spot the &quot;object&quot;, which has a slow gliding movement across the sky. I (Michael) jump out of bed and tumble into a metal suitcase, it makes noise, so my girlfriend wakes up. Together we observe through the window (which I open) the following: a very clear, yet dim light, pointing down, but not like a beam of light, the light moves west above, and (as Lotte formulated it) at one point strikes a small sparkly! I see it as a tiny thin line going from the bottom edge of the light with a small lump at the front end, this can be seen approx. 1/2 sec., the object is now somewhat far to our left. Immediately after, the light starts to dim and light up a bit two or three times, after which I can no longer see it, but I should be able to, as the object still couldn&#39;t be that far away. After discussing the experience and turning and turning it in my head, I am 100% sure that the light we have seen has been at the bottom of something!, meaning downwards. We believe that the distance approx. fits with the object having flown over Randers Fjord. A little after 00:32 a plane came in a north-easterly direction (presumably a passenger plane), its height we guess is approx. twice the speed of the object and approx. twice that of the object. I&#39;ve seen the raw amount of shooting stars, planes and satellites before, this was definitely not it. Finally, I would just like to say that here, where we live, there is not a sound to be heard in the evening/night, nor was there in connection with the observation.",

We drive but do not see the light again nor anything it could have come from. There wasn&#39;t a house with lights in it or anything else that could explain this.

When I got out I looked around as I thought there was someone walking around out there. As a reflex, I looked up at the sky. There were a lot of white dots circling the round as the object moved back and forth between my summer house and the neighbor&#39;s. The dots formed some rings, and I think the inner one had 4 rings, then 8 and finally 16. And since it was moving at 70-90 degrees, it must be right above my head, and it looked like the object was very low in the air. But you couldn&#39;t hear anything, it was completely silent. At first I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes, I went straight in for 30 seconds and when I came out it was still there. So I ran in and woke up my mother as she could be used as a witness. When I dragged her out, she saw it too and was very surprised by it. I happened to have my digital camera with me, so I ran out and took some pictures, but they didn&#39;t seem to materialize. But I haven&#39;t deleted them. After a while I got tired of looking at it so I went to bed and so did my mom so we don&#39;t really know how long it&#39;s been there but 30 minutes minimum.",

When I look out and up at the sky (I have &quot;skysight&quot;), I see against the dark sky something that appears to be round and with blue and red lights in 2 rows placed on top of each other. It hovered right in front of my house, but higher, and it quickly disappeared again behind the next ridge. After a second or two &quot;it&quot; came back and hovered over the roof of the &quot;Family School&quot; right here next to my building for a 3 - 8 seconds. It had blue and red big lights on the sides. A row of red and a row of blue. As it flew away there was a very quiet deep hum!! But not mechanically. WHAT WAS IT?? Today I spoke to a DRONE specialist over the phone, as many of my friends have suggested it could be a Drone. He said it MIGHT have been a drone. However, he doesn&#39;t know about the red and blue lights that I described AND he said that Drones are generally noisy!! The one I saw was practically silent. So he thought it was either a &quot;cumstom made&quot; Drone or a real UFO. Furthermore, he said, it was forbidden to fly inside the city like that without special permission, and he could not recognize the location or the colors of the lights I saw at all. He also said that Drones in general make a LOT of noise..... this one just made a low humming VUISHHH right before it disappeared again. Strange experience.",

At times the flash would disappear for minutes, only to reappear elsewhere in the night sky. The object flew in arcs, but the direction and shape of the arcs varied. The object also appeared to have varying speeds. As it turned out (completely without reasonable distance judgement) the object flew quite fast at times. It was definitely neither a plane nor a helicopter, and my best guess is that it was a drone. I tried to film, but the resolution of my phone could not capture the flash.",

It fell in a straight line, heading south, a good distance away from us. From when we first observed it and until it had disappeared below the horizontal line, about five or seven seconds passed. The object itself was dark, and not identifiable, but it had a greenish light, almost like a lantern on a ship (it shone very brightly, not like the meteors, in the pictures we have tried to compare what we saw with) in what can be called the front end, and behind it was a yellowish-orange-greenish &quot;flame&quot; light (like from a jet engine). This latter appeared when we saw the object, disappeared briefly, appeared again, then disappeared completely before the object disappeared. Our first impression was that it was a passenger plane coming down. And it really still is, since we can&#39;t find an explanation for what else it could be. We are writing, as it were, to ask if something similar has been observed, by radars, satellites or the like. equipment. Possibly. military, perhaps? Or if maybe a plane HAS crashed?!?

The sun is behind me, so there is clear visibility. 3 of the objects are uninteresting, they are about 600 meters above me and it is clear, they are some kind of white plastic bags floating with the wind (from the east). They move erratically and randomly. The last object was immediately more interesting. It was significantly further up and was moving slowly but surely to the east, i.e. opposite the &quot;bags&quot;. The shape was difficult to judge, but I observe it is in rotation on its own axis, based on the reflection it made at regular intervals. We observe the objects for 5 minutes, during which I think of finding my binoculars. I&#39;m gone for a minute max and come back and can no longer see the last object. Looking with binoculars around where it was, I pick up a small dark object speeding towards the west... I don&#39;t think it was the same object though, and it probably looked more like a bird... but a very busy bird. Looking through the binoculars I could clearly see that the white bags were plastic of some form. They still hover over Randers at a height of approx. 500 meters.",

I have never seen anything like it, it was too big to be a plane, nor was there the sound of a plane, but if you saw a plane from behind with the tail rudder and then without wings. It looked like the one where there was a light on either side of the tail rudder. But as big as it was, it couldn&#39;t have been a plane, because if it had been that close, it would have made a lot of noise.",

We have an agreement to film immediately, we see something suspicious and I took out my mobile. Unfortunately, before I had fumbled for the mobile phone, the object was already so far away and high up that it could hardly be seen with the naked eye, and I only caught a brief glimpse on the video. If you look closely, however, you can see the object glinting silvery. What was special about the object was its shape and its movement. I would almost liken the movement to if you rotate an oblong piece of narrow paper and drop it. Then it will also rotate around the longitudinal direction as it falls towards the ground. We have discussed whether it was a special type of helium balloon. However, it would then be a very fast-moving balloon, as in the course of 40 seconds it moved from above our heads, to away in the horizon at a height approximately 3 times the starting height. But again. Nothing can be rejected.",

Suddenly, a bright light comes from behind - I think it&#39;s a truck on the road, driving with its floodlights on. However, there is not a sound, and there is no truck either. Then see an orange-red ball coming slightly obliquely from behind my right side (southwest) fly straight above me and then disappear over the bushes/trees standing on my left side (northeast). There is no sound - no bright lights - no tail, just the ball. The sight lasts max. 3 sec, because when I get clear of the bushes (about 15 sec later), there is nothing to see. One min. later comes an oncoming cyclist who stops me and asks if I saw the very bright light in the sky - must answer that I only got the bright light from behind and that I saw a red-orange ball fly over. He hasn&#39;t seen the bullet. We agree that it must be a UFO and that it wasn&#39;t even that high up - I want to immediately shoot at 400 meters up and the size difficult to judge - but as it flies over? Outstretched arm - the size of a 2 crown. The moon was larger and the stars much smaller. It was not something from the air station - I and the oncoming cyclist agree on that.",

        "content": "I get up that morning to see the plants lined up and have a nice view of them. But then my eye catches the white light moving from the direction of 190 degrees, with an estimated heading of 70 degrees (compass). The light is approx. 5 times larger than Venus and has bright cold white light with a bluish halo. I assume it first for a cargo plane that is waiting to land in Billund or Karup. It looks like airplanes with landing lights on too early. But then after approx. 15 seconds, accelerate it to an estimated 5 times faster than before in approx. Two seconds. Now it has my attention. After approx. 5 seconds it makes a tight 180 degree turn and immediately after the turn down to the same speed. The light is still the same intense white light. What puzzles me besides the abrupt speed changes. It now flies approx. heading 220 degrees for approx. 15 seconds, where it again makes a sharp 170 degrees. After the turn, it is quiet for approx. 20 seconds and now it moves up to me 45 degrees, estimated direction 150 degrees heading. Suddenly it accelerates upwards, becomes smaller and smaller until it disappears as a tiny dot. It changes shape at no time. It didn&#39;t change color or intensity. It was totally silent. How high up it was, or how far away it was, is impossible to estimate. Have been wondering for a long time what it was?? Do you have a reasonable explanation for that? If it had been passenger/cargo aircraft with landing lights on, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to see them when dt turned 180 degrees, then I would have been able to see navigation lights, nothing, just the spherical cold white light with the blue halo. The halo, I estimate, is height reflections in ice crystals in the air. If it had been so high up that it was light from the Sun, but there was 45 min. to sunrise, then the light would not have been as bright, and the light would probably have been more reddish. At this time of day, there are city sounds again. I strained to hear if there was any engine noise, nothing, totally silent.",

        "content": "I had the most bizarre experience last Thursday. It was a clear evening and the stars were clear, so I sat and watched the beautiful view from the kitchen window, sitting on the kitchen table with the window open. I had been sitting there for approx. 5 min., when my eyes caught a strange sight. I saw a black &quot;plane&quot; glide by quietly. It was black/coke gray and had a cloud or fog/smoke around it, like a cover, but still transparent, so you could see through the fog, but you couldn&#39;t pick up the structure of the &quot;plane&quot; on the surface. It was almost a triangle and a square put together, it also had 6 black circles under it. (I only saw it from below). There was no light in it and it was completely silent. It was very close and yet quite a way up, I&#39;m a lousy judge of distances, but I stayed on the 4th floor in Sionsgade in the window facing Sions Church (which is the top floor in this rise). In the same yard behind there is a 14-storey high-rise building, it was approx. at that height. I am very interested to hear from others who have seen something similar or witnessed this experience themselves as I cannot find any other similar accounts. I&#39;ve checked everything, drones, spy planes, UFOs, etc... nothing like that is described anywhere.",

So we sat down on two chairs where the backs could be laid back. We first saw one or two shooting stars. My friend asked if we should go in and get some chips and soda - we did. I pointed and after a while he spotted it. The yellow lights had no tail behind them, thus &quot;shooting stars&quot; are excluded. We have seen satellites in the night sky before, and they were far from the satellites we were looking at now. We both asked each other if it could be a UFO. One flew out of the triangle formation and behind the other two so that they were now flying in a straight line. A few seconds later, the rear one flew the opposite way and continued away - it ended up being a small dot that then disappeared. We wanted to try to take pictures of it, but unfortunately you couldn&#39;t see it in the pictures - we only had phone cameras.",

        "content": "I was driving from Søllested towards Nakskov on route 291, and saw, immediately after I had come off the roundabout, a strong orange light to the west. The light initially appeared to be stationary, but as I moved, I sensed that the light source must be further away and higher up than a floodlight or similar. At one point I pulled over to the side and got out of the car to make sure there were no reflections in the car window. At the end of the observation, the light had become weaker and came a little closer to the horizon, it seemed as if the light had moved away from me in a straight line. I could not see any marker lights and there are no regular flight paths at the observation site.",

        "content": "I would like to tell you about an observation that took place way back in January 1975. A very close family member saw the following in the sky in the evening, at approx. 10 p.m. She had previously called you (we kept your magazine) and was told that there was &quot;a lot of activity in the sky&quot;. the second, the shape was rounded at the bottom, and on top was like a dome, divided into panes/windows. They were high up. There was exhaust coming from the objects. They kind of came &quot;out of the blue&quot;. They flew quickly over a distance and the family member described that it looked like &quot;the sky opened&quot; and the two objects flew in and were engulfed. The family member (obviously) never forgot this incredible sight. I can&#39;t imagine there is a natural explanation for this. It must have been 2 UFOs. I hope my account will be included in the sighting chart. At the same time, I also want to mention that the family member and I, also in the 1970s, saw another thing, a large red light that moved jerkily, without a sound and flew from right to left i.e. horizontally I would very much like to ask for an explanation. I think it will be very difficult to find a natural explanation for the 2 objects and also the big red light (NOT a plane or helicopter and not a star or planet at all). It is a fact that lots of people have seen UFOs over time. Items where you just have to say that there is no other explanation.",

Head south from us there is at least 10 km. to the nearest town (also small). We sit in dark surroundings to better enjoy the evening sky. Suddenly, 2 large white luminous objects appear (approx. 5-6 times larger than Mars, which we can see to the west). The 2 objects are vertically above each other. The halo around the 2 objects makes them almost 10 times larger. The 2 objects have a distance from each other of approx. 10 cm. (from our side of course :-)) The objects are clearly the brightest in the sky. Both objects become fainter in the halo and again after 10 seconds both objects just as suddenly disappear from the sky again. The experience left us wondering, and we still talk about it today.",

It flies straight, straight and low, I hear a hum from it/it, and it quietly disappears out there, to the south.?? I scout for it until it can no longer be seen.

I wanted to point out the spot to my wife, who was sitting next to me, but there it was lost in the cloud cover. Meanwhile, she catches sight of it for approx. north-northwest, where it stands almost still while it becomes sharper and sharper so that in the end it looks like a very powerful searchlight without us being illuminated at any time. After this, the light fades, as if moving outwards, where it finally disappears.",

Here is a fine view of the horizon line in an eastern direction, where the sky was cloudless. The sun was not yet visible, but the sky was reddish on the horizon. I saw three very conspicuous lights approx. 15-20 degrees above the horizon. The distance was impossible to judge. The lights were almost glowing and a bit angular. They looked more like a huge piece of quadratic silver paper with odd curled edges that the sun shone on. In an outstretched arm measured between thumb and forefinger, each light measured just about 4-5mm. Comparing the lights to a large star, they were several times larger. The lights appeared in a triangle formation - one to the left, and one approx. a hand&#39;s breadth and a finger&#39;s breadth further down - from there two finger&#39;s breadths to the right and two finger&#39;s breadths up the last light. The lightnings moved with small quick movements, but within their own size, ie measured with an outstretched arm, within 4 - 5 mm. Suddenly the middle light moved with a somewhat uncertain course up towards the right light at a speed so that it would reach it in 5-8 seconds, but my observation ended before the lights reached each other as I now drove down into the valley where the vegetation overshadowed the events. On my way through Farum and out along Hareskovvejen, I tried to catch sight of the lights again, but without success. Approx. 10 minutes later I reached the Helsingør motorway, where I drove in a northerly direction. When I got onto the Helsingmotorvejen in a northbound direction, I again had a good view in an eastern direction, but unfortunately the lights had disappeared. These lights were so dominant that I have no doubt that others must have observed them.",

The rest of us in the car looked out of the windows and also spotted it. I&#39;ve never before experienced that you see a shooting star and be able to pass it on to others so that they can too. managed to see it. The time was 17:53. Duration 2-3 seconds. The size was not a thin line like a normal shooting star but rather like a roman candle fired from the neighbor - though in the wrong direction - slanting downwards. There were no houses in that direction . The direction was slanted up from the right down to the left. I think it was almost vertical, but the rest of the family think it was a little more horizontal. I estimate that the &#39;impact&#39; was in the direction south of the southern tip of Langeland.&quot; The fireball on 27 January was seen in all parts of the country. It moved in a southern direction and ended up somewhere over N-Germany. It is therefore excluded that something from this meteorite may have fallen on Danish territory.",

Approx. 1-2 min after both had disappeared to the east, 2 identical objects appeared from the same place in a southerly direction, they repeated the maneuver of the 2 previous objects. And these 2 also disappeared in the same way. No sound could be heard from them, and they were probably 5-10 km, but difficult to judge. Just before they came into view for the first time, a white flashing object came. Presumably a scheduled flight on its way to Billund.",

I walk by the police station, listening to music in my earphones and happen to look up at the starry sky, as is my habit. Looking up into the sky to my right, my gaze falls on four round dull-white discs that, in formation, slide in a straight line along the direction of my walk. What I noticed was that they were almost undulating or fluttering, kind of like the way a flatfish might swim, very fast, probably in sync... I followed them for maybe max. two seconds before they disappeared behind some houses and trees. The first thing I thought was, it must be a searchlight of some kind, the kind you can look at the cone of light and see how the light ripples under the base of the clouds if they are low... There were just no clouds... So I thought maybe it was because I had just crossed a road and got some headlights reflected in my eyes.. But their/its movement didn&#39;t match the &quot;headlight reflection&quot; that you can see, like after a flash. They moved straight ahead, and &quot;waved&quot; as I said, very fast... Then I thought if it could be the landing light from an airplane, as there are quite a few airplanes that fly over Roskilde... But I don&#39;t remember any plane at the time, there were no recognizable flashes, and I have to admit I have never, ever seen such a &quot;light&quot; before... It wasn&#39;t really shining, it was more like dull ghostly shadows fluttering rapidly across heaven.. It was about 9:00 p.m. when I left my friend&#39;s place at about 8:45 p.m. ...",

        "content": "It was all a long time ago, but a friend and I had to go over to his place to get something, and since he didn&#39;t live more than 800 meters away, we decided to go over there, it was 10 - 11 pm, and I lived in Ydervangen at the time, and he knew a route that went from Ydervangen. We had to cross Hobrovej and over to the road where the scouts and Falck were and along a path that filled the parallel with the old barracks. On that path there was a large field on one side, and on the other you could see the barracks and the apartments we were going to further on. It was a cold evening and there was not a cloud in the sky. And since it was incredibly dark, we could see &quot;thousands&quot; of stars. When we have walked a short distance, I want to light a cigarette and therefore stop, as I cannot light the smoke because of the wind. When I had taken the first puff, I lean my head back to blow the smoke away, I see a &quot;star&quot; coming at a very high speed. This &quot;star&quot; comes from the south and is very similar to a star, although it was somewhat stronger. I point to show my friend this &quot;star&quot; and he spots it. While we stand and look at this object for a bit, I spot 2 other lights at the same speed and just as powerful as the first one we spotted. The 3 objects came from each corner, just as they had come from each corner in a triangular object. No. 1 comes from the south at high speed, object no. 2 comes from the northwest, and no. 3 comes from the northeast. These objects fly almost towards each other, and a good 20 to 30 seconds pass. Just before they meet, they stop and hover above us a good 1 - 2 km up in the air, and it takes approx. 3 - 4 seconds and the objects fly together or in formation in a southerly direction. I am a man who must have the facts in his hands and would very much like to know what we saw, because we know it. I can tell the difference between satellites, planes, balloons and other objects in the sky, but not this.",

        "content": "My friend, my brother and I decided to watch a movie, but due to the never-ending pestilence of bugs, my brother suggested we take a short break until we got rid of the bugs. My friend and I now saw our cut to go out in the backyard and smoke a cigarette. It is for lack of better words that I call it a backyard. It is a tile area of x5 metres, where we e.g. has our rabbit cage. It&#39;s half past three in the morning when my brother comes out and makes small talk while he waits for us to finish so we can continue the movie. Now we suddenly hear a kind of hum/hum/machine sound approaching from our right. We quickly look at each other to confirm the situation, and we quickly conclude that there is indeed this hum/hum/machine sound approaching relatively quickly. It can be clearly heard that the object is not very far from us - between 3-15 meters away from us, and although it is quite difficult to judge, we all have the opinion that the object was moving 5-15 meters above the ground. The object&#39;s speed is also difficult to assess, as distance also has an influence on our perception of the current speed, but it has not been much more or less than 20 km/h. All three of us listen and look like crazy, but even though we can hear that the object is in front of us now, we can&#39;t see anything. The object continues to the west, where it disappears approx. 10 seconds after we first heard it. It should be mentioned that at no time did we see the object or catch a glimpse of it. We are three very rational boys who all study physics, chemistry and mathematics, but this experience we simply cannot find any reasonable explanation for why I am writing this post. We could observe/hear the object over a distance of approx. 50 metres, and if the object had not hovered/flew, it would have been impossible to cover that route, as it would have been stopped by fences and houses etc. The sound is hard to describe. It was a strange machine noise, a sort of electronic hum. The sound varied constantly in power/volume/decibel. Under NO circumstances can it be an insect/airplane/helicopter. The sound was very faint, although the intensity of the sound varied rhythmically. Had we been 10 meters further away, we might not have been able to hear the object. We&#39;re pretty sure it&#39;s a small object. The route taken by the object is characterized by tall trees and houses. The object has thus managed to evade and fly past these trees and houses, so it might be thought that the object must have been controlled by intelligence. Finally, it should be mentioned that Espergærde is a provincial town in North Zealand. I myself live on the outskirts of Espergærde, and the object had a direction towards a forest area with fields and marshes. It is also noteworthy that the object passes us at 2.30 - the time when it is the darkest - despite the bright summer nights, we were not able to see the object, we could only hear it. We have considered whether it could be some kind of drone? None of us leans towards any explanation, or has an idea in advance of what it could be. The incident is close to inexplicable, which is why we don&#39;t expect you to be able to give us an answer to what it was we experienced, but one can always hope.",

Focuses sharply on the gizmo. Couldn&#39;t make out anything other than a strong orange spot that was still moving across the sky. Suddenly, 3 more slightly smaller orange spots appear from the same point in the sky that the first one came from. They move at the same speed and with a smaller distance between them. The last one also drops somewhat vertically towards the ground. It looked like a helicopter formation that had to land. The first big spot just turns towards the city and suddenly disappears. A little later, the other three turn in the same place across the city and disappear. Could there have been some fallout in the atmosphere or what was it that came across the sky? It was special but beautiful. They were twice as high up as Mars normally stands.",

        "content": "It is probably ten years ago, but I have often wondered about the experience, so here is the observation: My father picks us up from the house one evening in the month of March, as he wants witnesses to his observation. There are three of us (my mother, a young girl and I) who reach out and see it. An object flies slowly across the sky. It is not that high up in the sky, but it is difficult to judge the distance down to the ground. It emits a very bright light, has no sound, and the light is much bigger than satellites, airplanes, etc. There is nothing flashing. The shape of the light is not spherical, but flatter round, like a flattened sun. It flies slowly without changing direction. At first I think it might be a comet, but it is bigger and very close to the earth. Beneath the object, a cone light is suddenly switched on, just as a flashlight can shine out in a cone shape. The light stops abruptly a short distance below the object. We stand and look up at it, and it flies towards us and the house. My parents live out in the country and it is dark around us. The light is very bright and the object is flying right above us and we are standing in a mighty bright light that blinds us. My mother runs into the house scared, she says afterwards that she was afraid of radiation?? I stay standing and hold the other girl&#39;s hand as she is very scared. The bright light suddenly goes out and all that remains are three smaller lights in a triangle. I can&#39;t see the shape of the object. Now it flies away infinitely fast, but still no sound is heard. My mother runs upstairs to follow the object&#39;s path away, but it is out of sight. We are left amazed. We have often wondered what was flying above us. We were pretty upset about our experience afterwards. Do you have an explanation? Are there other observations that resemble it?",

It is completely rectangular with sharp corners and stands out sharply against the sky. It is completely dark and very cloudy, only the lower part of the horizon is cloudless. There is no moon to be seen, and nothing nearby to explain this strange luminous rectangular field. All three of us have seen it and observed it for some time before one asks what it might be. We can&#39;t find any explanation, and suddenly it&#39;s like it&#39;s disintegrating. It almost shrinks to nothing. As if it is evaporating from the outside in. It takes maybe 10 - 15 seconds, then it&#39;s gone. We talk about it when we get to work, but no one seems to have seen the same thing as us. In the following days, we pay close attention to the surroundings and the position of the moon around the place where we observed the phenomenon, in order to find a logical explanation if possible, but we have not been able to find one. Is there anyone else who has seen the same thing as us??!!",

        "content": "I went for a walk with children. The weather was fine (windless evening). All of a sudden I felt a strange but pleasant pressure of warm air all over my body. I thought hmmm... strange and looked up at the trees to see if maybe it had started to blow a little, but the leaves on all the trees were musty still. While we slowly moved on, I still felt the heat and the air pressure, then I look up at the trees again and see just behind them a strange object - machine (at a height of approx. 20 m max) in the form of two thick cigars joined by two equally long beams between. The cigars were very bright like highly polished silver and the bars were dark gray. This machine was completely silent and came very slowly directly above us and has been standing still for approx. 2 minutes I started whispering to the children (&quot;Hanna, Thomas look, look at it!!, it looks like a UFO&quot;). The machine began to move towards the south at the same altitude without a sound, and still I felt a blast of pleasant warmth over me. After approx. 1 min, the machine very quickly changed direction to the west and crashed into the sky at lightning speed and disappeared instantly. I was shocked but not scared, on the contrary I was happy and started thinking about the machine and explained to the children &quot;what is ufo&quot;, I thought if it was a plane or a jet plane, then why didn&#39;t their sound come after or below and they fly not at this height, and they don&#39;t light the seed and mm... many thoughts. It took approx. 5-8 min, and we went on, but then the feeling of hot blowing pressure came again, and then I look up at the trees again, no movement, think it&#39;s strange!! Looking up at the sky in all directions, and then the same thing happens again, the same object comes at the same height without a single sound, two glowing cigars connected by two non-luminous beams, hanging over us silently for approx. 1-2 min and flew in the same direction as the first object, and just as fast and without sound. Right after each time, the pleasant blowing pressure of the heat over me disappeared, and now I was so sure that I saw a UFO, so I ran home with the children and quickly told everything about what I had seen and felt. My husband&#39;s two sons ran out with me again (about 5 minutes passed), because maybe the UFO came again. We all stood together for at least half an hour, glaring at the sky above the trees, hoping the object would come again, but it didn&#39;t. To this day, I have told many times about my experience. And to this day very often (in the evening when it is dark) I look to the sky and hope that this object will come again and appear to me for a longer time with its pleasant warmth above me. No one can tell me I haven&#39;t seen this!! I only wish that people would trust others more if they experience or see something strange. I still hope that some other people in the world see such an object as I have seen, so that my experience will be confirmed. This year I have found a strange stone on Møns Klint, which looks like a meteorite (but it is not magnetic, like the one from Mars or the moon), so I hope it is a real meteorite.",

It was a bigger dot, perhaps like you have been able to see Venus lately. It was moving at a speed so I wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a helicopter or plane, and there was no sound either. It might have been a fast-flying drone, but the size of the light/dot in the sky, I don&#39;t think I can get a drone to vote either.

        "content": "I&#39;m not sure if what we saw was a UFO.......but it was mysterious anyway....especially after talking to several people today who also saw it. My boyfriend and I arrive driving a little after 19 up Feggesundvej towards Dråby Vig. When we are a little outside Alsted, we suddenly see more than half of the sky in a NNW direction light up strongly in a neo-green/white glow, with what appears to be a round &quot;centre&quot; from which the light emanates. We can only see the sea part of the &quot;centre&quot;, as we are outside Alsted and the hilltop that separates Alsted City from Dråby Vig. My girlfriend and I immediately started talking about the fact that there was probably another firework warehouse going off... and we quickly agreed that it was coming in the direction of Flade or Thisted. When we got over the hill, however, we could see from a distance that Flade by looked as it used to in the dark... We then quickly agreed to drive to Sø Bugt, from where there is a clear view across to Thisted. On the way, I called my parents in Thy. They hadn&#39;t seen or heard anything, but they had just lost the TV2 signal... Immediately I thought that maybe it was the Thisted mast that had fallen over in the strong wind (20-25 m per second). I ended the phone call. Soon we were at Sø Bugt... and I could immediately see that it was not the mast that had fallen... when I saw the characteristic red flashes on the horizon. But where was Thisted...... it was completely dark over there. Some time passed (x number of minutes, max. 3-4 minutes I think), then suddenly the light came on... first in the northern part of the city... then in the center of the city... and immediately after that everything was as it used to with regard to the lighting over from Thisted. But what the hell had happened? When we got home and were going to watch the handball WC, I could see that there had been a power cut as my computer was switched off. The next day I rushed online to see if there was anything on Thisted Dagblad&#39;s website or on DR&#39;s website under region midt og west. There was nothing! And it still doesn&#39;t at the moment. (Sunday evening at 11.40 p.m.). When my girlfriend came home from work on Sunday afternoon, she could tell that the water had been yellow in the morning when she had to make coffee. Sunday evening I was at some friends to look at a computer. When we sit over coffee afterwards, one of them asks if we know what happened over in Thisted last night? She had spoken to several people today (Sunday) who had seen the same light... and knew that the light had disappeared over in Thisted. They had all had short-term power outages and many suddenly had no more water!?? Our friends also had a brief power outage...... but no water issues... as far as they know. All those she spoke to also live at Mors. We talked about what it could be. The other of our friends perhaps thought that it could be the high-voltage masts in Thy that could have predicted the flash of light and the power failure, if the wires had been knocked together in the wind... if the power had gone... the power probably also goes to those pumps, there is water pumping around from the water works, as he said... but the rest of us didn&#39;t think it should be able to give so much light, and the huge flash of light we saw. We started talking about little green Martians.... that is, whether it was a short-term visit we had from a UFO........ who had foreseen the whole thing....... In any case, we CAN&#39;T understand that there is NOTHING whatsoever about the episode in the media!!! As I said, I don&#39;t know what it was we saw...... but I needed to get it out in print anyway..... so it doesn&#39;t just go into oblivion. It is hereby done!",

It moved rather quickly across the sky. Thought it looked strange, so I quickly took my mobile phone and filmed it, and this resulted in an 18 second clip in UHD quality, before it was so far above me in a south-easterly direction that I couldn&#39;t really could film it more, but also because I had a bad grip on my mobile and was about to drop it out of my window, after which I naturally stopped recording. I rushed into my bedroom, which has windows facing S-SE, to see if I could spot it there, but unfortunately I had no luck. Could possibly have been due to low lying clouds as it was partly cloudy that night. There was also no sound from the object, and that the object flew about twice as fast as a regular airliner. I also checked flightradar24.com shortly after the incident, and there were no planes in a large radius of Næstved at the time in question, and absolutely no planes flying/had flown from NW to SE. I have tried to find historical data from flightradar24.com or similar sites to support my claim, but unfortunately I have not been successful. As I said, I have a video of the object that I have uploaded on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qDi5k4lhn4 If SUFOI has doubts about the authenticity of the date of the video clip, since I first uploaded it and wrote to you now (been very busy), I can also send it to you in original format, with all the video details encoded in the information in the clip. If so, contact me by email or phone.",

The light consisted of 3 to 4 or more powerful lights in a row in the direction of flight. I could not see the shape of the object, but only the position of the light on this row. The light was yellow to orange. There was no sound at all. I would assume the altitude to be somewhat lower than domestic aircraft, rather a little higher than a sports aircraft flies in. The speed was calm and steady, but difficult to judge as I could not see the size of the object and the naked height. Looked like it was a bit quiet to the west but was hard to tell. There were no flashing lights as usual. aircraft, only the very strong downward-scoring yellow light.",

It was approaching the highway from the northeast, and in order to observe it more closely, I turned into a rest area. But in the time before I got hold of the mobile phone, put it on video recording and got out of the seat belt and opened the car door - it had reached right over me at full speed - and disappeared a second later behind some vegetation. I have divided the second recording that was on the video into single images. It looked like it was big, about 8-10 meters, and probably approx. 30 - 40 meters up.

We are approx. 250 meters from the village, which we approach along Egerupvej, when not far above the horizon (so probably far ahead) we see some (about 3-5, didn&#39;t focus on counting) fairly flat ellipses, all of which are yellow/white. It&#39;s still bright. So that was the observation. We drive into the farmyard at Bangsgården in Voldbro, where the company Interacoutics is based, and where I work as a newly trained person, to pick up an amplifier and a speaker (plays in a band). Soon after, we are on the road again towards Andebølle, where I and a few others rent a house, where we live and practice music. On the way to Andebølle we have our 2nd observation: 2nd observation: It is now dark. We drive on Assensvej towards Vissenbjerg. Approx. 2 km. from Bred, my father says: &quot;There they are again&quot;. He sits in the passenger seat and watches them from the right side window. Soon after, I see them through the windscreen, where they are heading towards Bred. They are now seen for approx. 45 degrees above the horizon and are oval - as opposed to elliptical. The color is now orange. Still in the form of rings. This time I count them to 5. They look like the Olympic rings, except for the color. They do not overlap each other, like the Olympic rings, but are separated from each other by approx. 1 times the diameter of the individual rings. Each ring has the same diameter as the moon. Their speed is approx. twice ours (from the time my father saw them until shortly before Bred, I picked up the speed to catch up with them, and we then drove about 100 km/h). We drive in a Morris Mascot, where you turn the light on/off manually with a button. I blink 3 times: turn off light, turn on, turn off, turn on, turn off and turn on. But no response. When we drive into Bred - approx. 100 meters from the track crossing, we lose sight of them as they disappear behind a larger hill ahead. We don&#39;t see them anymore. PS: In the days around this weekend, there was a NATO exercise in e.g. Denmark with the participation of forces from several NATO countries, so maybe we have seen some of their stuff. However, we have never seen anything like it before or since.",

They came flying without a sound at different speeds. It lasts approx. 5 minutes Our 7 year old daughter was standing on the other side of our house watching them. She came running through the house to us crying and was scared of them!!!! We saw the same, but only two objects in week 26 I think it was, They came at high speed from the south right after each other, stopped suddenly just before they were over us and then flew parallel to the west.

It starts when my mom is pregnant with me, here my mom and dad say they were chased by a green light 3 times... my dad froze and was scared. It happened in Langeskov near Urup in 1967. One evening, the light followed them to my grandparents&#39; home, and my grandmother said that she also saw the green light, which was an elongated cone of light, or like a large fluorescent tube, rotating above them . In 1974, when I was 7 years old, I went for a walk with another girl, who was then in a foster family, to swim in a stream that lies behind Hindemae in Skellerup. When we are on our way back along the field, we see the big gray round thing hanging in the air diagonally above us. It is put together with several plates at the bottom, with round rivets... there are 3 legs under it. Around its belly, there are black windows divided into fields, and I can see that there is light behind it. I feel like they are looking at us and we are looking at them. On top of it, there are several antennas placed somewhat randomly. We talk about how strange it is that it doesn&#39;t have wings, because we don&#39;t know anything about UFOs at this point. I run home and tell my dad, keep an eye on it, but it&#39;s getting away. My father and I go up to the terrace to see the rest of it, but don&#39;t make it. Since I am 12 years old, I am looking after children in Ellinge. Here I go out with the girls, we go for a walk in the field and then see a lot of white balls coming up from the ground, in the direction of where Hindemae is. The orbs come up vertically from the ground, stop high in the sky, the orbs stand still as if waiting for each other, then they pick up speed and now all fly horizontally. I ask one of the girls if they have a camera, she runs in for it and of course when she comes out they are gone. The last experience I had was when I was 17 years old and I was on a moped over to a girlfriend&#39;s place in Rolfsted, here a blue ball follows me out in the field, it flies horizontally, then a forest comes and it disappears behind the forest.",

It is point-shaped, possibly with a faint streak of condensation, but it may be the aperture of the eye that gives it. The color is orange-red to whitish, the light intensity does not change while it disappears into the horizon, as with satellites. From the time I spot it exactly vertically above me, until it disappears into the horizon, approx. 20 sec. Approx. 30 sec. after it disappeared, my older brother who was also out watching shooting stars, he had seen it since it appeared on the horizon, calls and confirms that it flew SIGNIFICANTLY faster than any satellites we have seen. 40 sec. from horizon to horizon would require an enormous speed even for the ISS, since it actually passes over the Zenith. Have since used &quot;Orbitron&quot; to search for satellites, but no luck. In general, I think it would be impossible for the sun to illuminate a satellite passing at such a low altitude, and since it had a constant brightness, I don&#39;t think it was a satellite.",

I quickly called my girlfriend who also saw the whole thing but she got scared and ran inside hehe.. Very convinced it&#39;s not a plane as we often see planes in the area. This was something completely different and much closer to a plane. When she had gone in, it glided on quietly across the sky and suddenly it disappeared.. Very cool experience!",

However, it cannot be a remote-controlled helicopter, as it disappeared into the clouds when it became cloudy.

        "content": "I looked up at the sky around 22, when there was something my eye caught, like when you can feel that a person is looking at you, even if they are doing it from the side, and you can&#39;t really see that they are looking at you. It was an instant sensation I had of looking up into the air, for something was moving up there. I was bored. Just got off bus 5A at Sundbyvester Plads and had to find Gyldenrisvej to go up to someone I was staying with. I live on Bornholm, but have lived on Amager for 14 years before that. I was on a weekend to visit friends in Amager. I looked up and noticed that the street light was a bright orange color. These are the ones at Sofiegade and Gyldenrisvej on Amagerbrogade. I thought it was a nice color. Not as white as the other street lights. There were no people. Yes, a man came while I was looking up, but I didn&#39;t ask him if he saw anything up there - because then he would think I was crazy. I looked at the street lamp and it was a bit hazy in the air and windy and cold. Fairly clear weather with some low clouds. Then I saw a big yellow spot next to the street lamp. The lantern was elongated square. (What&#39;s it called? a rectangle - a long narrow rectangle) and slightly oval. The spot was circular and very yellow. And then it moved. I thought - it&#39;s me and my eyes. I am getting old - spots are coming before my eyes. I don&#39;t see this. It is optical illusion. It&#39;s my eyes playing tricks on me, like when you look up at the sun for too long and then look down. Then you see stains everywhere. I looked down at the ground. Rub my eyes. Then up again. It was still there. It flew in a straight line from west to east just above the lamppost - quite high up, but not as high as an airplane, and then it flew across Amagerbrogade - quietly and actually a bit slowly - but completely aimed towards the east. Was it a weather balloon? Was it a satellite? It was silent. At first I was scared of them, but then I felt completely safe watching it. Was it a UFO. Some object? But maybe it was a satellite. Then it was just really far down towards the ground. Or was it the kind of one-diameter party balloon that someone sends up with fire in it? No, because then it would have flown hither and thither with the wind. It did not fly according to the wind. It was controlled by some technique. It was quite large. A circular dark yellow ball or spot about the size of a saucer when viewed from this distance. So it was probably about the size of the bottom of a helicopter. There were no wings or anything. Only a round ball with a color almost similar to the street light on Amagerbrogade. It lasted approx. 5 min., then it disappeared into a cloud on its way to Sweden. I have never seen anything like this before and regardless of whether it was a satellite or a UFO, it was beautiful and it was a fantastic experience.",

It changes direction and then moves slightly to the south (towards me). I call my better half and ask her and her parents to find binoculars. While I&#39;m talking to her, object appears to be moving down towards the ground (never been high above, in my estimation) and suddenly takes a decent jerk back up and then moves further east (would consider object on this time must be above Skibsbylejren). My mother-in-law gets the binoculars pointed exactly in the direction of the object as it disappears from view, possibly hidden by cloud cover. Don&#39;t know what it was, but it was big and it moved at a very high speed at times. Can write off the moon as it hung to the east/southeast and had a completely different colour. Will reject an airplane as I have never seen an airplane that can change speed and direction in the same way nor have I ever seen an airplane that glowed so brightly in this color.",

        "content": "On the night between 30 and 31/7 I sat by the bonfire in the garden to enjoy the silence. It was very dark and as far as I remember there was no moon. Around. 23.30 I lit a small fire, which is important in this context, as the fire could have an influence on my observation. I didn&#39;t have a watch on, but I estimate that approx. 1 hour when I suddenly hear a strange hissing/hissing/pulsing sound passing over me at very high speed. I couldn&#39;t look directly up into the sky because of some trees and had to walk a few steps forward to see what was making this strange sound. Unfortunately, I could not see anything, but only heard the sound disappear for a few seconds behind the silhouette of my house. I also noted that there were no sounds of cars on a nearby main road. The sound was very intense and almost electronically pulsating, which is why I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a large bird where you could hear the whirring of the wings, nor was it the characteristic steady sound of an airplane. When the sound came from upstairs, it couldn&#39;t possibly be either. wet pieces of wood in the fire that sizzled in the flames. As mentioned the speed was very high so I only caught it for a second or two before it was right over me and followed it for 3-4 seconds as it disappeared into the darkness behind my house. Furthermore, I took it to mean that the sound was relatively close to the ground, as my house has a flat roof, which makes it possible to see further than if it were a house with alms. pitched tile roof. As I could not see anything, I cannot specify the course, but my immediate assessment is that the sound came from the south-east and continued in a north-west direction beyond Roskilde fjord. I have never heard or observed anything like this before and have therefore scoured the Internet to find a place where I could report my experience, and perhaps get an answer as to whether there were others who had heard or seen something in the same period of time, just before or later?",

        "content": "On my way home from work, I walk through a large, green area surrounded by 2-storey blocks of flats. In fact, it is a large lawn with benches, handball goals and a playground that lies behind a horseshoe formation of social housing. On the way through this green area you have a clear view of most of the big, black evening sky. And when there are no clouds, you can clearly see most of the countless stars in the evening and night sky, if you are not standing in a certain place, so that one of the few trees in the area is in the way of your field of vision. On the way through this green area, I suddenly catch sight of a small, round object in the huge evening sky, which comes rushing across the sky from an eastern direction. The object is very, very high up in the atmosphere. It is difficult to describe how big or small it really is. In the evening sky, the round object occupies approximately 15-20 times as much as one of the respective stars in the sky, seen/assessed from my field of vision, mind you. The object can almost be described as round, as it looks most like a star. That is that the object in the sky looks like a luminous dot, just like a star, but only 15-20 times larger, and therefore yellowish/luminous in colour. The only thing that is remarkable is that the object almost comes rushing across the evening sky from an eastern direction. There is no sound to be heard from the object. Its speed is enormous, as it flies much faster than the usual airplanes often seen in the evening sky. You can typically stand and follow an airplane for several minutes in the sky. Its speed is snail-like as you follow the airplane across most of the evening sky. But this object came rushing across the sky from an easterly direction, then zig-zagged in very fast motions and completely disappeared in a north-westerly direction. (I walked with my back turned to Orion, which is in the southwest direction). The object flew almost in rapid zig-zag movements, changing from a northerly to a westerly direction 3-4 times in total, before disappearing completely from view. It almost disappeared into nothingness. As if it has completely flown out of the visible celestial sphere with its enormous speed in just 4-5 seconds. The object and the incident itself are therefore very sparingly described, as the mentioned object&#39;s presence in the evening sky only lasted around 4-5 seconds. I wonder a lot about the object. Mainly because of its fast zig-zag movements, as shooting stars most often come descending from top to bottom. Incidentally, a shooting star can only be seen in max. 1-2 seconds. My experience is that you barely manage to see a shooting star before it has already disappeared again. The particle burns itself up in no time. But this object was no shooting star. It was an object that almost consciously controlled itself. A luminous object in the evening sky, which came rushing from an eastern direction, then flew 3-4 times in zig-zag movements far, far up in the atmosphere, and finally completely disappeared into nothingness. I highly doubt it was a meteor or satellite.",

There were quite a few seagulls flying high up, but there was also a small object moving very slowly to the south. We talked about maybe it was a balloon from Tivoli, as it flashed a little (the reflection of the sun) and moved with the direction of the wind. We observed this thing for approx. 15-20 minutes. Suddenly it flew with great speed in the complete opposite direction and was gone in a few minutes. Later we saw two balloons and they did not behave the same way at all. Since half of Kbh&#39;s population has been lying with their noses in the air in the good weather on Saturday (18/5-02), perhaps there are some who have seen the same phenomenon from the same angle?",

I&#39;ve thought about reporting the incident countless times, so now it&#39;s happening to the best of my ability. 2 classmates and I were standing at the end of my parents&#39; barn talking one summer evening. Suddenly we saw 2 oval, luminous objects sailing across the sky, slightly offset from each other. It was going pretty fast, faster than low-flying aircraft, and it was unlike anything we&#39;d seen before. We saw all three of them and we were speechless. I haven&#39;t really talked to anyone about it, apart from the immediate family, because no one believes in such a thing. The year is around 1960. What I wrote in the form is what I believe is correct. I heard that someone had been seen over Esbjerg that same day, but at the time I didn&#39;t know where to go with my knowledge. This is as I remember it. It is etched in my memory because what we saw was so unusual and fantastic. I am glad to be told so that I do not pass away without passing on the observation.",

After some persuasion, he also goes out into his garden and looks. He sees the same thing as my boyfriend and I. He also confirms that there should be no planets in that area. After that I grab hold of my father. Both him and my mother go out and see the same as the rest of us. I look, initially, at the incident intensely for approx. 30 minutes Here it does not move at all. When I come out again approx. 30 minutes later. Has it moved significantly, but otherwise behaves in the same way. This time I look for about 5-10 min. Comes out one last time approx. 30 minutes later again. Here it has moved even more significantly both vertically and horizontally. I have taken quite a few pictures and film clips, but unfortunately all with the iPhone xs, as I have no equipment for anything else. On both film and photos, the changing colors are clear. I hope to hear from you. As it was quite a special experience and I am very curious as to what it may have been.",

Am actually quite skeptical about UFOs, meeen still thinks this phenomenon is quite strange by now.

I was a passenger (in the front seat) in a car, driving in a westerly direction on the Silkeborg motorway (route 15) just after 17 (to the best of my knowledge it was 17.05-17.07). We were approx. 500 m. before exit 23, i.e. just before the Boar. The sky was completely cloudless and there was full sun. Here I became aware of a &quot;thing&quot; in the sky directly in front of us, ie. due west or slightly more north, 30-35 degrees above the horizon. The most remarkable thing about the object was that it was incredibly glossy/shiny. I would immediately describe the color as chrome/silver, but the surface reflected the sun&#39;s rays so much that the object was almost bathed in light, which means that I cannot be sure of the color (it may have been a very light light blue), as well as the shape was also difficult to see due to the strong reflected light. However, I got the impression that the form was &quot;complex&quot;, i.e. it was not smooth, &quot;closed&quot; or symmetrical, but appeared to have &quot;things&quot; protruding from the center, especially in the part of the object facing the earth. Since I couldn&#39;t estimate how far away the object was, I also can&#39;t estimate its size (if it was the size of a helicopter, it might have been 300m away, but it could also have been bigger and further away or smaller and closer). I looked at the object for 2-3 seconds, then I looked away for a split second, triggered by something in the traffic or something the driver of the car said, and when I turned my gaze back to the place in the sky where the object had actually been less than a second before, it was gone! As I said, the sky was completely blue without a cloud, and at the place in question there is a completely clear view of the sky (there is a tall mast in Klank just south of highway 195, but it has nothing to do with the observation, as the object was significant further south in relation to it). No drone, helicopter, plane, bird, balloon or anything else that I know of can fly away so quickly or, as seems to be the case, suddenly become invisible. I therefore cannot explain what it was that I saw (the driver of the car was concentrating on driving and did not see the object) and I would really like an explanation.",

There was a series of flashes at intervals, as seen from an aviator, however the interval varied slightly. Blinking also moved like a flier from right (north east) over to left, also at varying speed. At first I just thought it was an airplane, but it moved illogically and was impossible to follow with the eyes, as it was as if it was jumping around. It disappeared out of sight behind a house and soon after, another one came from the same side, exactly as before, while the last one reappeared shortly after. I saw what I believe were 3 objects at the same time in different locations. I think there could be practice at the air base at Nørresundby, it must be in that direction, but the illogical speed and interval make me write here, as it seems unbelievably mysterious and I would like to hear a possible explanation. Sometimes it could actually look like anti-aircraft guns like you see in movies. It&#39;s a little hard to explain. After half an hour or so I went in, don&#39;t know how long after or before, it has been going on. One thing is for sure, there was something moving across the sky, it flashed really violently every now and then, the speed was fast from the right, but the speed decreased further to the left. It varied in both height and speed, there were several objects with the same pattern, and some only appearing as flashes now and then, almost stationary. It was a bit cloudy and some flashes could be seen reflecting in the clouds located between the flashes and my location. Hope there is an explanation.",

I wonder how it got there, but went on into the woods and thought no more of it. As I am on my way out of the forest a little over half an hour later, I can from a distance, approx. 200-300 m, see that the big car is still there, and that on top of that, a few meters above the other smaller lights, it had turned on a powerful light that lit up the parking lot without me being able to see the car itself. While I go and try to see what it is, I mostly think about police work, or some road light maintenance. However, the bushy light is lower than the street lights and partly stronger and whiter than the street lights. I look to see if there is anyone (police) standing by my car, (which is on the opposite side of the parking space at Skovvej). When I come out of the forest on a path 50-80 meters from the car park. I don&#39;t know how many seconds I look, but I notice that there is no one by my car and now that I have come out to the road, I want to see what it is that is holding the parking lot. There is now no light at the parking lot and the parking lot is empty. A huge car transporter etc. would under no circumstances be able to get away so quickly and without a sound. In addition to the large light that illuminated the area, there were several smaller rectangular white lights, these placed partly horizontally (mostly) and some that were slanted (about 45 degrees). It was the placement of these smaller lights that made me think of a double-decker car transporter. It was only afterwards that I thought that such side lights would not be white.",

At Slagelse we turn off onto the motorway, where we can see that it is to the right of the car as we come down onto the motorway.

I look towards the east, and the spots can be seen approx. 45 degrees up in the sky with a constant distance of approx., which corresponds to 4 cm when I measure with two fingers in an outstretched arm. All the time with the same distance - right after each other. Luminous first approx. 20 sec. as powerful as the strongest &quot;star&quot; in the sky (Jupiter). After this, both spots lose brightness at the same time and become very weak and difficult to see, but they continue the path - right on the heels of each other in exactly the same path. In total, I observe the two bright spots for 1:30 to 2 min. - they eventually become so faint that I can no longer see them. I would estimate that they move approx. 20 degrees across the sky during this time - so very slowly. It was a very clear night sky - without visible clouds, and a few seconds later I observe an elongated shooting star in almost the same orbit, but in the opposite direction - without it disappearing behind clouds.",

        "content": "Just heard that the Norwegian Armed Forces have released older information about UFO sightings. Of course, I was curious to see if my own would be included. It is, but rather lacking compared to what I and my then 8-year-old daughter saw on the way home from a friend&#39;s house. We come walking across the lawn, enjoying the lovely evening and suddenly look up. Is something huge standing, hanging or flying in the sky? My daughter gets very scared, grabs my hand, and wants to run home, which we do. Unlocks the door, runs to the west-facing window, and we see that it is still &quot;hanging&quot; there. We stand and observe the large object for about 5 minutes, after which I call Værløse Airport in a sort of helplessness, because they must be able to register something on a radar screen, I thought! The fact that I got that thought must be because my father worked precisely with radars at the Air Station. The object my daughter and I saw was round, cylindrical and almost curved on the &quot;underside&quot;. On the side or around were what I would call windows, and from these windows streamed a strong, almost white light. It was very, very spacious, and my daughter and I talked about it being at least as big as a jumbo jet, except for the shape. At the top sat a thing that resembled the fruit of a maple tree, but just huge. I missed my camera - it came with my husband when I got divorced - so I tried to borrow it from my neighbor, but unfortunately she wasn&#39;t home. I ran back to my apartment, not wanting to miss the weirdest, most amazing sight I&#39;ve ever seen! Overall, I would guess that I spoke to a man from the Airport for approx. 10 minutes We had the pleasure of observing the heavenly body, which today I will call an airship, for about 25 minutes, after which it disappeared very strongly and with a &quot;loud, thin&quot; sound towards the north-west. Of course, I can talk to my daughter about the incident, and it has also happened that I have told about it to a select few, but I cannot rid myself of a feeling of frustration at having seen something that not very many can nod in recognition. That is why I was happy to find that the Norwegian Armed Forces have released a number of reports, but saddened that so many of the details that I described to the man on the phone have not been included at all. So we, my daughter and I saw: Clearly and clearly in detail, a very, very large round, cylindrical, almost round at the bottom, object, with luminous &quot;window parts&quot;, and with a maple fruit-like, screw-like object at the top. Back then in 1984, we talked about if there could be people in it, it could hold a few hundred, but it is very difficult to judge the size ratio of a large thing in the air that you have never seen before. I remember that my daughter was scared during the experience, and didn&#39;t much care to talk about it for a long time afterwards. I myself still feel weird about this experience, which of course I know is completely true, but I wish I could talk about it without having to fear that people will think it&#39;s all just vivid imagination.",

It flew very slowly, but it was too dark to see if it was rotating or something else. My wife observed two stars disappearing and reappearing and the cloud that appeared out of nowhere. I was the one who alerted her that something was up. None of us wanted to believe what we had seen straight away either when we read in the newspaper about the visit to Moscow, but when we saw the pictures on &quot;You Tube&quot; we recognized the outline of what we had seen.

        "content": "We sat in our yacht and enjoyed the first warm summer evening of the year. At 22:55 I saw two &quot;bright stars&quot; appear above the treetops on the Funen side. The two &quot;bright stars&quot; came into view right in the middle of the faint red evening glow that was still in the sky. We now saw that the one &quot;bright star&quot; was moving towards us, and I was sure that it was an airplane where the &quot;strobe light&quot; had turned into a fixed light. Approx. 90 seconds later, another &quot;bright star&quot; appeared on the horizon, right next to the &quot;bright star&quot;, which was still completely still in the sky. After another 90 seconds, another &quot;bright star&quot; appeared in exactly the same place where the others had come. I hastened to get my binoculars, as the first &quot;bright star&quot; was now approaching on a course directly above our heads, and I could now see with the naked eye that these were no ordinary airplanes (I have a pilot&#39;s license myself). With my binoculars I could see pretty much nothing but a large orange/brown light that appeared to have a clear core and it looked like the light was reflecting in a parabola. The &quot;bright star&quot; passed directly above us at greater speed than a sports pilot can achieve. When the &quot;bright star&quot; had passed us, and I was still following it in the binoculars, it was as if something shaded the orange/brown light and the object was now completely darkened (about 45 sec after it had passed directly above our heads). As I was now not &quot;dazzled&quot; by the light, I could now clearly see the outline of the object and easily follow it for a further 45 seconds. I&#39;m sure the objects were not fitted with wings as I know them. Exactly the same procedure happened a total of 10 times, in an unbroken streak (fantastic experience). Despite it being a quiet evening, there was no sound at all from the objects. The 10 overflights lasted approx. 15-20 min., and while we were looking at the scenery, 2 airplanes crossed the course of the objects, but at a higher altitude. However, not louder than we could clearly hear the engines from the planes. We sat and discussed our experience and looked at the last &quot;bright star&quot; for approx. 40 minutes, during which it stood motionless in the sky. At exactly 23:55 the last &quot;bright star&quot; started to move, but it took a north/north north east course and thus did not come over us. This object did not go &quot;dark&quot; like the others when we saw it disappear. Exactly at 24:00 the object disappeared below the horizon. I tried to contact air traffic control in Kastrup, but was referred to the local police, who I contacted and told about our incident. I am sure we saw what I have described and I would be very grateful if you would contact me if there is an explanation for the phenomenon.",

When the specter disappeared behind a roof, I ran out into the street to see more. Here I met two young men, one of whom had also observed the spectrum, albeit in a green hue.

We were 6 people who decided one evening to go out on the town in Ærøskøbing. We walked down Smedegade to reach Vestergade, where there was a small tavern called Arbo. When we were walking down Smedegade, someone suddenly shouted, &quot;hey, try to look up at the sky&quot;, and when we looked up, we saw a flying object that flew incredibly close to us, so close that we could see the bottom of the object, it was perfectly flat and had an oval shape, in the middle there was a strong red light as if it shone constantly, it did not pulsate, like on a passenger plane for example. At first it flew fairly slowly, but then suddenly the red light disappeared and the object took off more into the sky flew away at tremendously fast speed, but there was no engine noise at all.",

        "content": "Have experienced the same light, at approx. same time, here it looked like more than a light, and it came from Frederiksberg and flew north (observation was from my balcony facing Jagtvej with a view of Mayor Jensen Allé). Was out getting some fresh air and saw the light, which was bright red at first (like an airplane landing light). When it got close it looked like three red lights. So the first thing was that it was a small plane or a helicopter, the Rigshospitalet is not far away, and I can see a helicopter next day both night and day. But back to this light, then it started behaving differently, there was no sound, and the flashing lights that are on an airplane or a helicopter were missing, which in addition started to slow down and keep still in the air ( like a helicopter), then start to rise and the red lights went out one by one (the possibility that they went up into a cloud cover is high. It was slightly cloudy that night). The funny thing was that a day or two earlier I experienced the exact same thing at about the same time, so the possibility that it is either a helicopter or maybe a drone being tested is high. Have fun with UFO, have always had a great interest in this subject, as all my family members have experienced things that lie under the UFO concept. It took off when I had to read the New Testament for my confirmation and discovered that this is actually the best UFO book ever written (after that the conversation with the priest was so much fun). But since I was simultaneously dealing with film, photography and lighting on a semi-professional level and then on a professional level, I could start sorting through the films, video and photos that are there and find a logical explanation, and that has given me the knowledge that probably 99% of UFO sightings can be explained logically. And today with cell phone cameras, it is true that more UFO videos and photos are taken, but the quality, especially at night, is of such poor quality that it can&#39;t actually be used for anything, plus today there are more funny man-made things flying around the air. There is speech and military and civilian drones (where you experiment with swarm, both within military and civilian drones). It is certain that drone flying is developing into the aerial version of crop circles, that is, that you do not want to come forward, as what you have done is often illegal (have used a drone within a built-up area and in a far too high altitude), and the people who do it often get a cheap laugh when the so-called UFOs come on TV and more. Also, the Chinese hot air balloon has become very widespread in the West. So yes, I am interested in UFOs, but do not believe in UFOs, after several years of studying this, the only thing that can convince me that UFOs really exist is if I have a third degree close contact, and i am able to prove it with prof video and photo otherwise not. But I am amazed at how many people throw money at authors and lecturers, who are often nice people with a high education, whose only purpose is to make a lot of money by throwing pure gas at people who really believe in it. Maybe you should write an article about drones and about drone swarm flight, as they are seen both night and day.",

It had white light on the two &quot;side wings&quot; and red light at the back. It was more wide than long. None of the lights blinked, everything shone with uniform power. It was sort of shaped like an airplane, only it wasn&#39;t as long as one at all. It was VERY wide on the other hand.

        "content": "When I wanted to walk my dog on the evening of 18/02 2008 at 20:40, a strange white light that hung almost directly above me caught my eyes. At first I took it to be an unusually bright star, but soon realized that the object was moving. My sense of logic told me that my eyes were playing tricks on me, that I was most likely just imagining that there was movement, and that maybe it was actually me that was moving and not the object, since I know how easily you can be fooled by stars and the like. Furthermore, it can be difficult to determine whether something is moving or not when you don&#39;t really have a fixed point. However, I could tell that the object was moving when I had to turn to keep sight of it. Again my brain kicked in and told me it must be a plane. But even this thought I had to give up when the object suddenly accelerated very quickly, heading north. The story could well end here, but the truth is that it only begins here. Before I continue my story, there are just a few things I need to get straight. I live in a place where we often see planes, both propellers, fighters, helicopters and very often scheduled planes, heading towards Billund airport, and we have never had difficulty identifying planes and other air traffic for what they were. This evening, however, something happened that neither I nor my wife had ever seen or experienced before. As described earlier, the luminous object disappeared in a northerly direction at a speed I have never seen an aircraft move at before. Naturally I was surprised, but at the time did not attach any particular importance to the observation. This changed, however, when at the same time I saw several similar objects coming from the southeast and rapidly approaching. At this point I decided to call my wife who was inside the house. Pretty soon after she was out by my side and together we now watched about 20 to 25 very bright and white lights cross the sky about directly above us. They kept a mutual distance and speed to each other, without at any time changing formation. It should just be added that they were not in close formation, but had several hundred, or maybe even a thousand meters between them, (depending on how high up you would judge the objects to be. Our assessment was that they were very high up!). Still, it wasn&#39;t hard to see that they kept the same speed and formation. We followed the luminous objects from their appearance in the southeast until they disappeared out of our sight to the north. Just for the record, I will try to describe the weather this evening, which I would describe as slightly cloudy and with a bit of wind. I am fully aware that stars that sometimes disappear behind a cloud could easily be mistaken for a moving object. I must clearly state here that this could not be the case in any way. (Although I was initially tempted to use this explanation myself, for lack of a better one.) But the movements of these objects were so pronounced that we had to turn approx. 180 degrees around our own axis, in order to follow the flight of these objects across the sky. I would also like to point out that after these &quot;luminous objects&quot; disappeared beyond our field of vision, we could ascertain that no stars could be seen in the sky. What I was trying to illustrate by this, of course, is that it would be natural to assume that if we had mistakenly taken stars to be luminous objects in motion, then there would necessarily also be other stars in the sky, which there are not was, and they were unlikely to disappear completely. Furthermore, one could clearly see the movement of the objects in relation to the moon, which was clear in the sky this evening. Before I completely end my rather long story, there are just a few more facts that I must include. First, these objects, as I call them, were completely clear and white. They neither blinked nor changed their appearance in any other way. Normal airplanes, which, as previously mentioned, we often see, both during the day, evening and night, are always equipped with flashing lights (red and green, starboard and port lights). This was not the case this evening. Also, normally when we see an aircraft approaching Billund, these are almost always using the same approach corridor, or whatever we should call it. These objects were nowhere near what we would consider an approach to Billund. Thirdly. When we see aircraft on approach, or aircraft in general, the observation is almost always followed by distinct engine noise. Either at the same time or shortly after the sighting of an aircraft. This evening there were absolutely no engine noises to be heard of any kind. Neither before, during nor after the observation. Everything happened completely and utterly silently. One final piece of information I haven&#39;t gotten into yet is that the sighting lasted for about 10-15 minutes, from the time I noticed the first object until we lost sight of the last one. My wife participated in the observation from the time I called her out. This was approx. halfway, i.e. after 5-7 minutes.",

The light flies over towards Roskilde, and disappears with a snap of the fingers..! Subsequently, another light comes from the same direction, and moves in the same direction, but a much stronger light.. I confirmed that there was NO flashing or similar. These are 2 observations shortly after each other! My conclusion is that it was far too fast to be a plane.. Far too long to be a shooting star.",

In the sky hangs something that resembles a powerful star in brightness, but 2-3 times larger. The light slowly fades out, the object becomes more metallic/gray in appearance and slowly merges with the blue background in the sky. From my perspective field of vision, it is 2-3 mm big after the light has completely gone out. The sky was December clear with few clouds in the sky. The object was very clear. It appeared that the object was located well behind the few clouds in the sky. The object did not move - but it was visible for too short a time for me to identify whether it was moving slowly or whether it was a (very) strong reflection from e.g. a satellite.",

I wanted to make a small approx. 1 min film on my new phone Microsoft 640. I made the film and stood approx. 10 minutes afterwards and looked up at the beautiful sky and I didn&#39;t notice any UFOs in the sky. The next day I watched the film and saw that there was something wrong with the recording, there were 4 small lines in the film. Opened the VLC player, pressed several times the - key so that the movie played slowly, select full screen 1920, with approx. 1 second at a time. Then the four small lines became a UFO. After that I looked through the whole film and found one more UFO that was close to me, and on the film you can see 7 maybe 10 other UFOs in the distance like little dots flying up and down from the clouds. These UFOs fly at a tremendous speed and are therefore difficult to see with the naked eye. With all those UFOs, I&#39;m thinking that we might just have had a nice visit from the outside.",

However, the speed is slightly faster. Then thought it might be a small plane, but again no engine noise or flashing lights. I follow it a bit in its progress, when I discover another one on the same route. After a very short time, 3 completely identical ones appear, which also disappear in the same way. This is how approx. 10 pcs. up to a total of 1-2-3 pcs. at a time, completely silent with a stationary light and the same route. Of course, no more came when I finally got enough presence that I decided to get my binoculars. However, I had my mobile in my pocket, but those pictures only show small bright dots in the sky, nothing where you could possibly could see what it was. There is probably a natural explanation for the phenomenon, but what puzzled me was the lack of sound and that the lights did not flash like they do on airplanes and helicopters.",

At least they look a bit like (haha) stars, they are just as &quot;indistinct&quot; and shine in exactly the same way - i.e. not strong and artificial and no flash. The only difference is that they move. Fast - not satellite speed. They are to start with completely parallel to each other and move at exactly the same speed. After covering a certain distance they come closer to each other and suddenly it is as if they are playing with each other, close to each other, further apart, around each other. They disappear from our view behind some trees after about ten minutes.",

It looked like it was going to land, but then it flipped over and we spotted the port and starboard red lights. We stopped the car and turned off the engine. We could hardly hear any noise from the vessel. It came whizzing at high speed towards the car and flew over Strandby harbor and turned around again. We then started the car and drove 500 metres. Then it came back again, made a quick glance, flew out over the sea again, continued north and disappeared. As the craft made the loop, we could see a lot of white lights below it. It also had some sort of wings which were also filled with light. We agreed that it was a UFO, as small planes can&#39;t go down that far.",

I watched a pillar of light sweep automatically back and forth across the sky covering an angle of approx. 30 degrees. Approx. in the middle of the angle, the column of light hit an object every time it passed. The object lit up brightly every time the pillar of light hit it. The object, which was motionless, looked almost like a very large, upright lens when viewed from the side. The column of light, which turned out to originate from an automatic searchlight at &quot;Skovridergaarden&quot;, Charlottenlund, did not linger on the object, and moved quite regularly. Over the next 15-20 minutes the phenomenon became weaker and weaker, finally disappearing.",

We were walking in the street, in an ordinary residential area of the small provincial town, when we spotted a triangle-shaped object, which came flying silently and quickly across the sky on a sunny afternoon in June or July. The remarkable thing was that the object was difficult to judge from a distance. Whether it was 50 meters or 2 kilometers away is still unknown. But one thing is certain: the object was completely out of sight after 1 minute - without a sound - and without the characteristic white &quot;tails&quot; that a plane can sometimes drag across the sky. Finally, it should be noted that it was as if everything became strangely still when the object was visible. - Whether it was pure imagination, or whether the object really managed to put an end to the chirping of birds and the whistling of the wind, is not known. But the experience that I still think about took place - sure enough!",

I remember it was quite cold and there was quite a bit of snow. Suddenly we see in the sky, almost directly above our heads, a bright spot that moved with great speed. The spot glowed almost white. My father started talking about a &quot;sputnik&quot; - meaning a satellite, or maybe it was a shooting star. But the spot was just a good deal larger than a sputnik typically sees, and it was moving too slowly to be a shooting star anyway. We stopped because it was a little weird. Suddenly the spot stopped - completely! We were about to lose both our noses and our mouths! It hung there for a while, then changed direction 90 degrees! It then continued at the same speed as before it stopped. It disappeared behind the horizon to the north. We discussed what it could be. There was no engine noise - and it was a very quiet evening. I have since thought about what it could be....but can&#39;t find any answers. I have since graduated as an engineer, but nothing I have learned here has been able to explain our observation.

Driving on the main road A13 to the north, and where the A13 cuts through the small forest, Skatskov, I randomly observe a series of lights above the trees. At first I think it&#39;s a plane which is very, very far down, but the lights are still and there are no red flashlights. Suddenly the lights move quite slowly across the trees and over the car heading west. There were maybe 6 or 8 lights, placed in a straight line going north - south, and a pulsating orange light further to the left. The location and distance between the row of lights and then the pulsating orange light is just like a triangle. A car was driving behind me, so I couldn&#39;t just brake..., but got myself together to roll down the window to hear any noise. sounds. There was no sound, only the screeching of the car&#39;s tires, and when I looked to the left, to the west, to see where it disappeared to, there was no light at all, although there were a few trees to obscure the view. I have no idea how big it was, but I would think it was max. 100 meters above the road. I have to say that the lights were not strong, but almost dull yellow.",

I think I was approx. 5-10 m from it, so I saw it really clearly. It looked like a large bicycle helmet with two lights next to each other. It was approx. 60 cm. It was gray with a blue wide stripe down the middle. I drove slowly past it and looked at it really hard. There were cars behind me, so I didn&#39;t manage to get a photo of it, unfortunately. There was also another bus and cars in front of me, so they must have seen something too. It was a little below me, so I could see that it had a dark blue broad stripe.. Don&#39;t know how long it was there, because it was there after I drove past it. So I didn&#39;t see it disappearing…",

When I get really close, it hangs over the field approx. 20-25 meters above the ground. Now it no longer flashes, but constantly shines down towards the ground without really lighting up anything. It is approx. 150-200 cm x approx. 100 cm x approx. 40 cm. I drive past, turn the car around, drive back, but there it is gone. It hung in the air over the field off Fjordvej. If what I saw was man-made, I would very much like to be in touch with whoever made the flying thing, as I have worked in the model hobby myself and have never seen any flying model hang in the air like that.

And since our world leaders haven&#39;t said anything to us that it&#39;s ours, it was a natural thing to also see a little about UFOs and aliens... And it was even more exciting, so I watched a part of all those movies , which is online, and then shelved it again, until sometime in November 2005, when I came back to it and watched &quot;The Disclosure Project&quot;. How can they refrain from telling such things...? If all those people aren&#39;t lying...?! Well, I&#39;m watching a lot on the Internet and I&#39;m sitting in my room at 5:00 a.m. on 1/12 2005 and I&#39;m watching these UFO things on the Internet... And all of a sudden out of out of the blue, I get up and lift my patients and see over a block of flats outside my windows a powerful white pulsating light... A bit like small explosions, or those &quot;led lights&quot; you can buy in a fireworks shop, then it, if I think so, is since there was no sound, at least not through the windows. As I&#39;ve always had an interest in fireworks, I&#39;d just stay and see if anything else happened... if only I knew better... The white light changes to a light like a car with its high beam on so it&#39;s slanting down towards the road and something I can&#39;t see lifts up and turns green at the bottom... And here it says I mean... I&#39;ve never seen such gunpowder... But the now green at the bottom and black or not present flying thing, starts just as slowly and goes to the left, or west, with the green light on, and goes then over for approx. north west where it just shuts off and the show is over... total anticlimax that there is a ufo right in front of you... will shoot it to be max 500m away and then there won&#39;t even be a grand finale, but just lights out... I&#39;ve just had to think about it a bit myself, and haven&#39;t really talked to anyone about it, only my dad, and his reaction was just &quot;screw you&quot; like... but there it was, for the feeling in the body I have not experienced before... a little scared and curious at the same time, fantastic! Hope you can use it for some peace out!",

Around 18-19/1-12 I drive to our house at 7pm and see a large circular light source orange/yellow coming flying towards my direction of travel. I would guess the light source is approx. 100-150 meters above the ground. At first I think it is a plane, but there is no sound and no other light on it. When I first see it, it is approx. 500 meters from our house. I drive to the house and get out of the car to observe it. It is about 150 meters from our house and 100-150 meters above the ground. There is no sound at all and it moves quietly and smoothly in a smooth motion. When it is approx. 50-80 meters past our house, it stands still for a few seconds and then starts to move out over the water, and then it is as if it accelerates violently for approx. 10 seconds it disappears into nothingness and finally disappears completely. The entire observation lasted approx. 2 minutes For this sighting, I was the only one who saw it - the next one was seen by both me and my wife. This took place on the same day as in Malling - namely on 12/2-12 at around 10 p.m. My wife and I are sitting on the sofa watching TV when Janne (my wife) spots a light approx. 50 meters above the ground around the neighbour&#39;s house. We rush to the window, and then I spot the same light source that I saw around the 18th-19th. January. A glowing circle/ball in orange/yellow. We only observe it for approx. 8-10 seconds before it disappears. So on Tuesday 14/2-12 my wife observes it again. This happens in the evening around 22.25 when she comes home from a visit to her mother. She sees it again when she comes driving towards our house. Again it is above our neighbor&#39;s house hovering from west to east. She rushes in and calls to me, but when we come out together it is gone. I am very interested to hear if anyone else has observed anything similar during this period. The reason I am writing is, among other things, the video on your website and have just read about a person in Hjørrin,g who experienced something similar in January.",

We wondered and also thought that it could be a star, but it was strange that it had moved across the sky and now just stood still. Every once in a while we saw a red light, but it wasn&#39;t that obvious and it didn&#39;t flash all the time like an airplane. The object shone too brightly to be an airplane and there was no sound.",

I suddenly noticed that if I focused my gaze on the object, which was still moving extremely slowly with an almost zig-zagging changing direction, for a particularly long time, it seemed that everything else I could see began to go dark . That&#39;s why I also made sure to look at other things in between. At times I could also see what looked like a purple ring around the object. I kept waiting for it to get closer so I could see what it was, but due to its constantly changing speed, which was always very slow, at some point I got tired and went home to report this observation to SUFOI.",

My father rolled up the curtain and looked out. Just above the genbo&#39;s roof (point west) he observed a ball of light. He could not say anything about the distance, but stated that it was the size of a tennis ball.

I look out of the car window, where I have the Moon on the right and the daylight, which is making its way, on the left. Suddenly I see a very bright, white shape, which flashes up briefly with a repetition, approx. 1 second after which it is completely dark again. The time was 02:40. The object had a very special shape. And of course I have my own explanation. I have also, a few minutes later, drawn a drawing of the sky. I would naturally like to share it with you. I am left with the feeling that many know &quot;It was something you had not seen before&quot;. I can hardly believe it was an aircraft of earthly origin. When you see the shape and the completely white light, I think about whether it is, for example, the back end of an object that is getting ready to leave us. Now, if it had been a Jetfighter, from the nearby air base in Skrydstrup, it would probably be more of an orange to bluish light, as combustion takes place. But could it be thought that the object uses light as propulsion. ? I&#39;ve been thinking about that a lot since that night.",

        "content": "In the period from 01:09 and 6-7 minutes onwards, we were 3 people who were out to get some air and cool off a little from the party we attended. It was overcast and the moon disappeared in time and time. Sometimes it was completely clear, other times it was covered in thick fog, so that you could only see the light behind, and other times again it was completely gone (i.e. also the light) because of the fog. Suddenly, 2 luminous objects arrive at a relatively low altitude, but at a speed that is somewhat higher than when you see an ordinary airliner. They came from an eastern direction and flew in a south-southeast direction. While we were looking at the 2 objects, another 1 came into view and followed the other 2. The first 2 were offset from each other in terms of height, and the 3rd was level with the lower one. We watched them for approx. 3-4 minutes and talked about how they were very atypical objects. We also discussed where Kastrup was in relation to where we had seen they came from. Our wonder was now that there were 3 machines that apparently took off at the same time and so at that time of the night. When they were gone we dismissed it as a little prank. 1-2 minutes later, 2 others arrive and shortly after 2 others again. Now there were 4 on the horizon all offset from each other and at the same speed as the 3 earlier. There were no sudden movements up or down. It was at a fixed (relatively high) speed. Again, the discussion turned to what we actually stood and watched. The sky was still very cloudy. One of us suggested that maybe it could be the exhaust from F16 planes because it was very yellowish and because the speed was so high. But there was no noise from planes or anything else. There was also no question that the objects were flying in formation in any way. But the heights were different and the speeds the same. Except for one of them, the 3rd, which flew so fast that it reached the 1st before they disappeared again. Just when we thought we had seen the last of it, another 3 came staggered. So not on the &quot;heels&quot; of each other, but at different heights and at the same speed. Also the same speed as the previous ones. These 3 objects disappeared in the same way as the previous ones. Of course, we were now somewhat more keen to see more in order to get closer to an explanation of what we saw. But despite the 15-20 minute wait, no further incidents occurred. Not so strange, after all, we all think we must have seen something from &quot;outer space&quot;, but really it is probably just a UFO sighting. We are therefore very interested in hearing about what it was that we saw and whether others have had similar experiences that night. We do not believe that so many planes have arrived or taken off from Kastrup within that short time and at that time of day. We also do not believe that 10 F16s should be training at that time of day. There must be a more rational explanation for what we saw. We have also not been able to find anything in the various newspapers and internet media that mentioned what we had seen.",

We drove along Ølsemaglevej towards Højelse. When we get to the small mill, we turn left and then right towards Højelse. Here we see the light in the sky for the first time (9 spots of light which form a square and there are two of them which revolve around themselves and each other). At first we don&#39;t say anything to each other, but just drive. We come up to Højelse Church, turn right, and drive past Højelse School, turn left down Baunebjergvej. Here I ask my wife, she also sees what I see, to which she replies yes. We get down to Ejbyvej and drive to the left (now we can no longer see the two lights). We turn right off Assendrupvej and drive a short distance, approx. 400 meters and there they are again. we stop the car and turn it off, roll down the windows to listen, but can&#39;t hear anything, we keep quiet for maybe a minute, and then we drive again (the bright spots are about 200 meters in front of us, and a little to the left . All the time we observe them in the sky above us, there are clouds to the left, but clear stars to the right. We drive west along Assendrupvej again all the while looking at these lights. Then we come to Ladagervej, where we turn to the right, and gone are those lights. Then we turn left onto Gammel Skolevej, drive 100 metres, and then they are there again. Right onto Hestehavevej (they are still there), then right onto Åbakkevej (then they are away again), park the car in the driveway. Get out of the car to look for them, and there to the west about 200 meters out in the field a little to the left, there they hang for the next hour. We come in with the children, let the dogs walk , have to light the wood stove, so I bring firewood over to the shed and see that they are still there.",

Either it was a huge airplane that was just about to fall from the sky, or it was also way too close (as the lights were a little far apart). But how could such a large machine turn so fast? And why couldn&#39;t I hear them when I went out on the balcony? Then came the 5th and then the 6th light. No. 2 and 3 kept turning and then No. 1 disappeared behind a cloud. Then No. 2 did the same, and afterwards No. 3 and No. 4. Then No. 5 disappeared, while No. 6 remained there, without moving. After 15-20 seconds the last light disappeared behind the same cloud. I tried to take video with my old cell phone, but all you can see is the light from a window in that building &quot;under&quot; the lights. It was strange and mysterious!!!",

Me and a friend should have gone to Grøn Koncert, but we decided to stay at home. So we were not influenced by alcohol. I had a terrace that I went out on. It was still bright. I spotted a round object that came hovering over a few blocks close to where I lived. Now it&#39;s been a few years, but I remember that the object was not very high up, it was clearly visible. It floated in a special way, a bit in a zigzag. Sometimes it would hold still but still move, and then it would float again. I called my friend and we looked at it. It looked like a silver ball, but at times it looked like it was black at the bottom. Maybe it revolved around itself? It was metallic, sometimes the sun seemed to reflect in it. It was silent. It sounds strange, but we both sensed that whatever it was, it was aware of our observation. There is a huge chimney on the road where I lived and the object came to an abrupt stop right above it. Like it was curious and didn&#39;t know what a chimney was. It looked rather strange. Then the most astonishing thing happened, that which made us both sure that it must be something unknown, not of earthly origin. It disappeared upwards, abruptly upwards, incredibly fast. You hardly manage to blink your eyes, and you thought it all felt so unreal. We were both shaken for the rest of that day and I felt a little anxious about sleeping alone at home. A few days later we heard on the radio that there had been other sightings in Vejle and the surrounding area on the same day. Not necessarily of the same UFO. Sometimes we have a bit of fun with it. There was a Green Concert that day. Maybe ET wanted to go down and listen to some music.",

After approx. 30 sec. it was as if a series of lights were lit, forming a circle. This continued for 30 sec. There was no rotation or change in speed. Ran to our bedroom window where my wife and son stayed. At the time of writing, I cannot say whether they could see anything because of background light. The object had now again lit the entire circle and in addition, 4 new lights had been lit/appeared, which could appear trapezoidal. My wife thought I should relax, but I was really up for calling. Couldn&#39;t get my mobile camera to work but it was absolutely amazing. The object disappeared at the same speed as it entered the field of vision with a direction to the east. It&#39;s partly cloudy with 0 wind, so I can&#39;t immediately understand if it&#39;s a balloon. Nor with the light formation it assumed.",

It was about 02:00 or 02:30 I saw in the sky what I first thought was a satellite coming from north to south. Suddenly at high speed, it made a 180 degree turn to the right and continued north at a higher speed. From lighting up like a regular satellite, it changed color to a brownish to dark red, probably due to the increased speed away from me. The object continued until I could not see it because it disappeared behind the trees. 20 to 30 seconds later I observed a flash of white light above me. It might look like lights from an airplane, but there were no red and green lights, and there was no sound. There were four flashes of light in a straight line from south to north in the same direction and high speed as the first object. The following check on the flightradar2 app shows that there were no planes.",

        "content": "At approx. 22.30 we were in the car on our way home from Århus, where we had been for grinding at Jysk Stenklub&#39;s workshop at St. Annagades School. It was a dark evening with quite a few stars and fairly clear weather. Along the way I noticed a light which I at first assumed to be a plane; but it moved in a strange way, until I realized that it did not move; but that it only looked that way because the road turned and changed direction. At the last rest area by the open road before Hovedgård, I made my &quot;driver&quot; drive in and keep still, so that it was possible to look at the phenomenon, which then appeared as a &quot;triangular&quot; star that flashed blue above the forest before main yard The drive up to our house is quite steep, and the car&#39;s headlights shined very brightly towards the forest, which was leafless at that time of year. The light pointed like an arrow up into the sky above the forest that lies just behind the garden. My &quot;driver&quot; turned off the lights and locked the doors while I stood looking at the sky to the south when something strange happened. From the eastern direction came an orange colored &quot;ball&quot;, which moved quite slowly and absolutely silently across the sky and disappeared in a western direction over the forest. It didn&#39;t go very high, but was visible for maybe 5-6 seconds. My &quot;driver&quot; didn&#39;t get to see it, as he was standing with his head in the car. I wanted to go out on a piece of open country road to see if the &quot;strange star&quot; was still in the sky as it had been when we drove home; but there was nothing to see, so we just had to turn around and go back home. As we began to walk back, and for my part still with my eyes fixed on the sky, I suddenly saw the orange colored &quot;ball&quot; coming across the sky as calmly and silently as before, but this time in the opposite direction of what had been the case up behind the house. I pointed it out to my companion and I think he saw it too.",

The light came from the south and at first looked like a plane/helicopter, but was too brightly lit for it to be navigation/landing lights. The speed was reminiscent of an airliner, but it began to reduce speed sharply. 30 sec. Then another &quot;object&quot; came from the same direction and in exactly the same trajectory. My boyfriend was standing next to me and we joked about it a bit at first. The first light turned 90 degrees to the west and flew on at &quot;normal&quot; speed. The second light now stood almost still almost above us, but then continued slowly to the west in the same course as the first. The other light began to glow more and more dimly and was finally gone. It seemed to rise vertically at high speed. The first light continued to the west. There was no audible engine noise. Ok I&#39;ve never believed in little green men, UFOs etc, but right now I&#39;m having a bit of a hard time ruling out weather balloons, helicopters etc. Finding logical explanations!! I would like to add that I have a background where I worked for a period at Kastrup airport, as an air traffic controller trainee, and therefore I have no natural explanation for what I have just observed, and therefore I have to post it immediately.",

The light was just twice as strong as the ISS. The color was orange or like fire, but in a fixed slightly elongated, defined area. The light flew very fast and in a straight path, will shoot the speed to 4 times as fast as ISS. It came up over the horizon in the west-northwest, and continued in a straight line overhead and disappeared in the east-southeast. It flew right through Orion before disappearing behind the rooftops. The light had constant brightness throughout the observation. I&#39;m used to being outside when it&#39;s dark looking at the night sky, have a pair of binoculars that I use once in a while. However, I have never seen anything of this type before, from one horizon to the other it took a maximum of 20 to 30 seconds. I don&#39;t think it was a satellite as they are usually not illuminated from rise to fall, the speed was also way too high. It also did not appear that the object was illuminated, but rather appeared to be glowing itself. The only thing I could think of that it could be was if it was the shuttle being launched, but it&#39;s not flying right now. But I could see that they have fired a rocket from NASA today at 3 pm Danish time. Don&#39;t know if it could be this one. Immediately after the observation, I called my little brother, who happened to be out walking the dog, he had also seen the light, but couldn&#39;t explain what it could be either. Due to the very beautiful sky and the much press coverage of the many shooting stars, I hope that there are others who saw the same thing as me.",

The first is as follows: I was on my way home from swimming on a Tuesday evening when a whistling/whistling sound caught my eye. It was reasonably clear, only a few clouds. Over my head in a northerly direction, I spotted something I hadn&#39;t seen before. Something moved across the sky. Eight glowing dots that together formed an H. They were moving at a slow speed, so I thought it must be a plane. But within a few seconds, they almost came together and changed direction and speed. They disappeared at high speed to the east. I&#39;m not sure how far away they were, but half a minute later a commercial airliner came and it seemed like it was closer than the object. There was a man waiting for the bus and I asked him if he had seen it too and he had. The second sighting is very clear in my memory because we were eight friends/cousins who saw this object on a fishing trip at Søndersø in Viborg. The eel fishing was not going so well, so we sat and talked when one of my cousins drew attention to something approaching from the NE. A low-flying dark object approached. In terms of size, it seemed like a large plane that was on its way to land, but there is no landing pad nearby. As it passed over our heads we could see light below the bottom and the object looked triangle shaped. There was no sound from the object and the speed was relatively low. When it had passed we sat and talked about what we had seen and one of the comrades was sure we had seen one of those STEALTH planes that the Americans have but there is no one who can tell about these planes has flown in Danish airspace and so low.",

Suddenly became aware of an object, which I first interpreted as an airplane, because of the color, quite high up in the sky, very far away. So typical airplane distance. Then it occurred to me, after noticing that it was moving somewhat slowly for an airplane, that it was not leaving the usual trail of condensation behind it. I looked for other airplanes, and in the distance I could make out another one to my left, which had the prettiest stripes on it. But this one had nothing. And another &quot;funny&quot; thing: the sun did not reflect in the hull at any time, as is otherwise known from airplanes. Usually there is a solar flare at some point, but this was just a non-reflective gray object that I sensed as saucer-shaped with a &quot;superstructure&quot; on top. It could very well be an airplane seen slightly obliquely, with the wing at the back as the &quot;superstructure&quot;. But again: strange speed, no condensation streaks and no reflections at all. Almost like the surface of a gray desktop computer. I observed the object as well as I could while driving on the highway, and only lost sight of it when it disappeared behind some massive clouds that lay to my right, that is, to the north-east. I observed the object for approx. 2-4 minutes.",

        "content": "On Saturday evening 18-08-01 we (my wife, our three children and a friend of our daughter) went to a street party at Frydendalsvej 2, Hostrup. At approx. 01.00 we decided to go home. We had to pull our bikes as we had no lights on. Our two boys and a friend had already gone home approx. at 23.00. When we got outside, we admired the beautiful starry sky. After walking 100 m, my wife saw something turning behind a sheltered fence (east of the road). At first she thinks it was the Northern Lights, which it wasn&#39;t. The phenomenon was small approx. 1 m. in diameter white &quot;cloud spots&quot;, light, in two circles, approx. 12-15 in the outer circle and approx. 8-10 in the inner circle. The circles revolved around themselves. It approached us at a low altitude, just above our heads it stopped while turning first anti-clockwise, then suddenly changed direction and turned clockwise. All 4 of us stopped to look at this. The phenomenon was about 15-20 meters above the ground. It was flat, there was nothing between these &quot;clouds of light&quot; or above, and you could hear nothing. We continued walking. The phenomenon began to fly east again, and for a moment it poured approx. 45 degrees. After we had walked now approx. 200 m, we saw it coming back towards us, we were now out on Sønderskovvej. It followed us from the east for 500 m and was above us again just after Hostrup, again it came from the east and stopped just above our heads. We looked at each other and tried not to scare the girls. We continued walking. The phenomenon flew east again across the river valley, we could see it all the time. After walking another 200m it returned over our heads. We stopped, looked at it. Decided to hurry. It disappeared again to the east, and we started cycling - when we turned right onto Varde Landevej. When we had cycled 300 m, we turned right down our &quot;little road&quot;. The phenomenon now returned and again stopped just above our heads. (It had now become cloudy). We now cycled the last 400 m home while it flew to the southeast. At home in our courtyard it came back again. All the time it revolved around itself. Our older son and a friend now also came out. We all looked up at the phenomenon. Kent now went in to call the information and got the phone no. at Flemming Poulsen, Odense. He got the description of the phenomenon. We tried to take pictures (there was nothing on them when they were developed). Sometimes it flew across the field to the east (while we could see it all the time) to return again. My wife went down to the neighbour&#39;s, approx. 80 m, the phenomenon followed, and was right over her head. When she later asked the children where it had been in relation to them, they answered on their left hand when looking east. It all stopped at 01.50, when it suddenly disappeared. We have drawn the entire route on a map. It must be stated that on Saturday night there was a town party in Starup/Tofterup 6 km away - to the east. Whether it could have been light from there, we can&#39;t get it to connect at all, there was no question of laser light at all, and if it had been light from a mirror ball, how can it be so concentrated over such a long distance and for approx. . 20 meters high with not quite flat terrain and large trees/forest, and how can these &quot;clouds of light&quot; follow us all the way home and then remain largely above our property for approx. 20 minutes.",

The object glowed white/yellowish and pulsated from weak to more intense, and back again, at intervals of a few seconds. At first I thought it must be a plane, but the object changed direction several times in a pattern not typical of a normal plane. At the same time, it seemed that the entire object was shining, and thus did not just have a flashing light fitted, due to the distance, this is however somewhat uncertain. Through the traffic noise I thought I could faintly hear the noise of a jet engine, and got the feeling that it might be one of the air force&#39;s fighters, although I am also very uncertain about this. After a few minutes the object disappeared in a northerly direction. I don&#39;t realize what it was I saw. But perhaps you can compare my observation with similar reports from the Copenhagen area, at the time in question.",

Then I called the rest of the party-goers out so they could see the same thing I witnessed. After that came 3, and then 2 and then 3, later 3 and 3 and 2, we counted 20 in all. We all agreed that it must be unidentified &quot;UFOs&quot; objects that came in a steady stream across the night sky. There came approx. 20 pieces in total in gliding movements across the night sky. Some of us would report it to SOK, i.a. the civil engineer who was there, but couldn&#39;t find a phone number in the confusion that we could call and, incidentally, where we could report the sighting. But ever since then I have been reading magazines and watching TV news to see if there were others besides us in the company who had observed the strange night show, but I have now read all the news and have not found a single remark about this strange sight. The objects flew just as quietly across the night sky. I tried to take pictures of the sight but nothing came up on my camera as I must have had a flash on which someone told me was probably a mistake and in the dark without my glasses I was unable to set my camera correctly. The party was held in Farum, Brudedalen no. 13, on Saturday 21 June, but it was past midnight, i.e. Sunday early at 2.10 the observations were made. I was neither drunk nor crazy, I had agreed with my husband that I was the one driving that day and had therefore not been drinking. There were civil engineers and engineers among the company, who, like me, agreed that it was a completely unusual sight. I have tried to write for TV news, but I have not seen anything described on the subject, and I do not understand, because the observations lasted for over 20 minutes. It surprises me that there is no one else but us who has seen the scene, I am thinking of radar from Copenhagen Airport, which is not far from the observation point. The reason I&#39;m only reporting this to you today is because we were going to a 90th birthday party in Skive in North Jutland on Sunday morning and didn&#39;t get home until today, Tuesday at 5:00 p.m. I would like to know if anyone else has seen anything.",

There are fields and cattle, I stand and listen to the birds, and turn to the right, look up, and what I see, I think at first is a helicopter, but no propellers, and no machine sound, but a kind of windy sound , which came from the bottom of it. It glowed red and white, so I thought it belonged to Odense Hospital, but no, it flew right over me. I quickly sent a message to my daughter who was inside on her computer. I was probably startled, but it was no worse. I was wearing a headlamp but took it off and shined it on the object, strange.. it sort of stopped in midair and turned down towards me as if it was observing me for a few seconds. I couldn&#39;t manage to set my camera on my mobile but recorded the sound of &quot;it&quot;. I stopped lighting it. It turned around and flew towards Lillebælt, that way out of there. Haven&#39;t seen anything since. Got curious.",

Objects were completely silent. The same was seen on 30 July 2011 at 22:34 approx. There it was an object that flew from north to south as seen from Bryggervej, 3200 Helsinge. On 18 June 2011 at 22:33 in the evening, I am driving on the Sorø country road and see 5 large flying fireballs, which are dark above, floating up over the horizon. The first two were close to each other and approx. 200 m after, 2 new fireballs came floating. The last one came approx. 300 m from the others. They hovered over the sunroof of my car so I could look right up at them. They were very large and completely silent, and they floated in the same direction towards Ringsted and at the same pace. Approx. 1 month later I saw a ball of fire similar to the one in the afternoon coming up over the horizon at Vridsløsevej in Næstved. It disappeared into a garden at the end of Vridsløsevej. It was even bigger than the others I had seen on June 18th. Have given them a lot of thought afterwards. They made a big impression on me. I got a picture of 2 of them from June 18, but unfortunately it was taken in poor resolution, but you can see them in the picture.",

After a short moment, the orb rose vertically into the clouds and disappeared. Soon after, two more fireballs came from the same direction, they also disappeared into the clouds. Shortly before 22.00 the fourth bullet followed exactly the same route. Some adults subsequently claimed that they observed a dark dot disappear in a close direction. Maybe a bag/parachute from an emergency rocket. No noise or tail of fire was observed after the balls, which were the size of a traffic light.",

        "content": "Yes, sigh, I had hoped to find out that by chance there were about half a million other Danes who had seen what I saw then, especially because I can&#39;t even remember the year for sure. But as I said, it was in the summer that I had a summer holiday, and it wasn&#39;t before &#39;80 and not after &#39;83. It was late and I was standing on my balcony when I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I was immediately convinced that it was no &quot;natural&quot; phenomenon, but I looked very intently anyway, hoping to find something familiar about the thing. How big it was I don&#39;t know because I don&#39;t know how far away it was when I saw it. But it was elongated, looked like an airplane without wings and about a third shorter than a normal charter plane, like a short cigar. It was completely white, without any kind of writing, numbers or symbols, but with a lot of &quot;pipes&quot; all over it. There were, as I recall, no lights flashing, but it seemed lit from the outside, so white was it. It moved very calmly and completely, completely silently (it was a very quiet night so I would have been able to hear it) from east-southeast to south and slightly to the southwest. And I glowed. I ran through the entire registry; could it be an aviator? No, no wings, no flashes and no noise. A helicopter? No. A hot air balloon? No. An American Air Shuttle? I thought about that for a bit, but firstly, there was nothing on the machine, no text, no flag, and secondly, you would probably have heard about it in the TV newspaper if such a thing came past Denmark. Then I made the big mistake of calling my mother, who was sitting out in the kitchen, but instead of just getting her out there so she could be my witness, I shouted: Mom, I&#39;m looking at a UFO. .. and then I was ordered to bed in a hurry, and it was many o&#39;clock, and I saw visions, and it was also too crazy and... I turned around for just a few seconds, and when I turned around again, the thing away, piss away. If it had continued at the speed it had had until then, it should have been only a little further west, but it was gone, and I was so sorry not to have seen how it disappeared. And it took approx. 15 years before I told anyone about it, - most people look at me like I was the closed one, but I know now it wasn&#39;t a dream. Has anyone but me seen it?",

Above me, the sky is completely dark and starry, while the sky to the south is illuminated due to the city&#39;s street lighting. To my great surprise, I see in the sky above me 4 disc-shaped objects. The 3 fly in a triangle, while the fourth flies a bit by himself. They have come from the north and are moving south. They would be invisible if it weren&#39;t for the faint red/orange light that outlined them and formed a pattern at the bottom of them. I called my husband a little panicked, who came running out and saw the same thing as me. My husband is a military man and has never believed in UFOs/aliens or anything like that. But, like me, he&#39;s a total nerd. Unfortunately, we could only see them for approx. 30 sec. As the lighting of the sky caused street lights to the south, making them invisible/impossible to see. They flew high. Higher than sports planes, but lower than the high-flying passenger planes. They were silent and appeared large. Despite being disc-shaped, you could still see that there was height on them - they were not completely flat.",

They move reasonably fast in a long line, although not all equally fast, and it is immediately just below the cloud height, which I estimate to be max. 1000 meters. At the same time, we notice that the clouds move from south to north. so the lights do not move in the direction of the wind. The entire session lasts max. 60 seconds, and we both notice that it happens completely silently. The lights are orange, almost like from hot air balloons, but the speed and direction make it impossible for it to have anything to do with hot air balloons.",

I go out to her and she points in a southerly direction where there is a black object hanging (a bit like a spaceship - wide at the bottom and tapering at the top) with orange flashing lights at the bottom of the object that pulse around in circles . She says that it came flying quickly from the west, in connection with the burning of some fireworks in the local area - which made her attention directed to the sky. The lady initially thought it was an emergency flare - as I am a sailor and we live close to the fjord - I had to observe carefully in case of an alarm. The emergency flare is bright red and lights up for approximately 30 seconds. with smoke development, so it wasn&#39;t. The black object rocked a little, but was reasonably still in the air for about 1½ minutes. The object then slowly disappears to the south - and almost evaporates into the sky. The distance/height is difficult to assess, as the size of the object is undefinable, and the clouds hang low/close at dusk. But estimated the object appears to be 0.5 to 1 kilometer up.",

But the reason I would call it a UFO is that this object is flying a very curved direction, zig zagging and flying again a little straight, a little to the northwest, but still low horizontally. I shout to my girlfriend to come see a UFO and we stand together watching the funny way this &quot;little star&quot; flies until the light gets too dim and a lamppost closer to me makes it more difficult to see more.

I see a boomerang-like object fly over my head for approx. 300 meters high. At first I thought it was a larger species of bird heading towards the Brabrand lake, but I will assess that the speed was far too high for it to be a bird, and the wingspan of the object was more reminiscent of a small private plane. It had better not be a plane as there was no sound or any visible signal glances which I suppose you have to fly especially at night at such a low altitude. I also mean to observe two pointed cylindrical shapes under each wing. The object flew in a completely straight direction towards Gl. Brabrand and disappears into the darkness. The object had no visible lights and could only be seen by moonlight.",

It is possibly over the houses we could see further ahead, as Børkopvej ended at a T-junction. It&#39;s not something we&#39;ve seen before.

After it passed so that we could see the &quot;back end&quot;, the light gradually got dimmer and dimmer, but you could still see a dark shadow. We have quite a bit of helicopter traffic over the area, but we hear them. The tourists send up quite a few rice balloons, but I just think the speed was way too high, since there was no significant wind at ground level, but now I also know what the airspeed was at that height. I was wondering if it could be the International Space Station, could that be the solution??",

The 3 dots flew in the same direction, but they zig-zagged in sharp jerks independently of each other. There was no sound to be heard and I could see ordinary planes in the sky characterized by their red and white flashes and slow movement across the sky. The distance could not be judged as it went very quickly. When I stopped to look at the stars, a man in a tracksuit ran by, but he was gone before I saw the 3 orange dots. I got to thinking if it was secret planes patrolling the skies now in connection with the American terrorist attack?",

First, 4 orange bright (constantly) luminous objects could be seen flying in formation, like &quot;panes on a deck of cards&quot; - these could be followed for approx. 1 minute, after which they seemed to rise very quickly, and the lights faded, and disappeared very quickly. Immediately after this, a new object came from the same direction and on the same course - again clear, constantly luminous, bright and strong yellow. Disappeared in the same direction as the other 4. Quite shortly after 2 objects from the same direction and on the same course as the others - again clear constant luminous clear &amp; strong yellow. Disappeared in the same direction as the others. And again very shortly after the last 2 objects from the same direction and on the same course as the others - again constantly bright clear &amp; strong yellow. Disappeared in the same direction as the others. It all had a total duration of approx. 5 minutes. There was no sound to be heard - and that evening it was completely windless in Bogense. It cannot have been a question of airplanes, balloons or satellites.",

My wife had just lit a few candles when she noticed that there weren&#39;t very many stars in the sky. As I was about to comment on this, we discovered a large circular orb heading our way. It glowed VERY bright orange and a little yellow. It came closer and closer and we were deeply concerned with this phenomenon. Suddenly it stood still for a few minutes, then jerked to the right of us - to the left of the phenomenon. After three to four jerks it stood still again and then VERY quickly &quot;flew away&quot; and it disappeared into the horizon. We have of course investigated whether this could be a plane. It is out of the question, because then it would have been on fire and would fall down. It couldn&#39;t be the aurora either - because it&#39;s not just a ball, and it doesn&#39;t shine that brightly either. My wife and I are convinced that this was a real UFO, but there must be more people who have seen this phenomenon.",

They come from the south-southwest, not in any formation, but very scattered, dripwise and well over several kilometres, and after they have passed the New Little Belt Bridge they head east (towards Copenhagen). And they are not scheduled planes that we know of, as they sometimes come from the same direction, but partly the scheduled planes take the direction of Billund Airport and partly the light from these objects is extremely large, clear and bright yellow-orange - yes, it actually looks like UFOs as we have seen from the TV. We can see that this looks strange and I rush for my digital camera, I take a picture, but unfortunately I can&#39;t turn off the flash, so there is nothing to see in pictures (immediately anyway), I take a more, this time without flash and zoomed in on one of the objects (and this is okay). I wanted to take more pictures with the whole night sky on to show a number of the unexplained and strange objects... BUT before I can click the lights disappear... you&#39;d think &quot;they&quot; saw the flash from my first image and command blackout for the entire fleet. I expected to get an explanation in the press the next day... but it didn&#39;t happen - I wanted to state my observation... but where and to whom? I mentioned the incident to an acquaintance and he suggested that I consulted ufo.dk - hence this report! You would immediately think that there are many, at least in our area - Fredericia/Middelfart/Strib, who have seen this?",

As I consider going back inside, I see from my left a luminous object coming floating at high speed across my garden heading straight for the church tower... Its route was very significant to me, as one from my garden can see the top of the old water tower to the northwest and the top of the church tower in the opposite direction... The object appeared just above the water tower and followed in a straight line towards the church tower, however it disappeared in a &quot;fading&quot; way before reaching the church tower . I perceived it immediately and was able to follow it all the way without any problems... I managed to think a lot of things.. And the first thing that crossed my mind was that it was a shooting star that I remember seeing so many of on countless summer camps and canoe trips.! But I quickly realized that it couldn&#39;t be - otherwise it would have to be the first square shooting star I&#39;ve ever seen. Only when it was directly above the garden did I notice its actual shape – if I have to describe it briefly, it looked like a long airplane wing, but there was no airplane body to be seen in the middle of it. I managed to notice the way it was lit - there were no flashing lights or lamps as you often see on regular aircraft - it seemed more like it was lit from within - or the way a statue or building might be illuminated from upwardly shining floodlights. Against the night sky it looked a bit yellowish - and from the way it came into view, it seems that even before the water tower it had been illuminated for a while... And it was only when it had reached the opposite side that it kind of dimmed the light to disappear into a kind of pocket in the sky – just above the church tower. The route had no bends or curves, it flew in a horizontal and straight direction. My first reaction was to stand for a moment and look in the direction it had disappeared in and I really tried to work out what it was I had just seen - not many moments after it had crossed my garden - then my boyfriend arrived out at the door; he had just taken out his lenses, as he was also on his way to bed. I told him what I had seen and he got a little &quot;squammified&quot; as I did - but he didn&#39;t come out on the terrace to look in the same direction as me as he can&#39;t see very well without lenses and so gave it up in advance. I explained to him the appearance of it and just had to recover a bit and sat down in my office chair in front of the computer - as I had to turn it off anyway. I estimated the time it crossed my yard to be at 01.45 – 01.46, and that the actual observation of it lasted about 4-5 seconds – so it had a fairly high and sliding speed. One o&#39;clock was noted on a note and I decided to sleep on it before I started looking for somewhere to report it to.",

Then it moves calmly across the sky towards Bispebjerg Hospital, where it stops and pulsates sometimes with sharp, bluish light again. Then it stops pulsing with the light and flies back again to where it basically came from and stands still again. That&#39;s how it looked.

I could see from a distance that the light curve was just changing to red. I slowed down and looked up at one light curve to see if it turned green. Right above this strange thing was hanging and I got so scared that I ran into the curb and almost fell off my bike. I looked up again, but the thing was gone. There had been no sounds at all. Everything was quiet. But I have been able to see the object with my inner gaze ever since. It&#39;s like it got stuck. It looked like a triangle, but with curved sides. These sides curved inwards. In each corner sat what looked like large round glasses. I don&#39;t remember if there were lights in them, but they were plain to see. The object hung quite far down, I would shoot it to have hung approx. 1-2 meters above the light curve. The object did not seem terribly large, I mean there approx. was 2-3 metres, between the 3 &quot;corners&quot;. There was a light pole quite close by, and I remember the object as being dark or silvery.",

It didn&#39;t last more than a good second, and I&#39;ve thought of explanations like the ridge of the roof interfering with my line of sight - but that doesn&#39;t really hold up, because I see lots of shooting stars where I live, and no one has acted like that, neither before nor since.

        "content": "Today 15/3 at approximately 14:45-15:10, during that time anyway. Is my mother out in her garden in the Boholte/Hastrup area in Køge. She looks in a southern direction towards Herfølge and sees an object, approximately the size of a car. It has a white underside, is elongated/egg-shaped and has 2 wing-like protrusions on each side, though smaller than normal airplane wings. It flies very very fast towards the north without a single sound, and it leaves no contrails in the sky. We&#39;ve seen planes here all day and they&#39;ve all had contrails. She follows the object with her eyes, and when it has reached a distance towards the north, it suddenly slows down and begins to circle around. As she describes it, it must have been over the north/western part of the Boholte area in Køge, as it begins to circle in a ring. After circling around in a circle a few times, it disappears madly quickly, again without sound or condensation, in a westerly direction, approximately towards Lellinge/Åshøj. The closest object must have been to my mother, I can roughly calculate, like a little 180-200 meters away, as she describes that it circled over a small forest we have between us and Boholte. She describes it as being at the same height as the planes that we have flying over us, which have to land in Kastrup. We live under the approach route to Kastrup and therefore see and hear many, many different types of aircraft every day. So it&#39;s been that far down, so she should clearly have heard the sound of engines, especially the furious engines that various drones are equipped with. The object cannot have been some form of balloon as it moved incredibly fast, stopped and circled, then disappeared very very quickly. Furthermore, it is blowing from the north today here in Køge and it moved from the south towards the north/west. What my mother particularly notices is the total lack of sound, as well as the fact that it could stall and then accelerate very quickly.",

I was 16 years old and in the 10th grade - I remember it because I told my physics teacher afterwards. I was standing in the kitchen of my childhood home on Kierulffsvej in Slagelse. From the window you could see over a field (Soldatermarken was called it, and there was a barracks which is closed down now). Over to a road further away (Rosenkildevej). It was bright and quiet. All of a sudden - as if out of thin air - there was a flying saucer some distance above the field (probably 10 m above and 150 m from me) - very clearly, as I have later seen them pictured; round and with &quot;windows&quot;. It was there for maybe 5 seconds. and just as suddenly was gone. Subsequently, a blue star appeared in the same place, which was also there approx. 5 sec. and then just as suddenly disappeared.",

In addition to the stage people, who now left and packed up, there were quite a few, mutually independent groupings, remained hanging in the square. Everyone looked up...and then looked - AN EXTRA TIME (!!), because none of us had seen anything like it before... ; an orange &quot;object&quot;; moved over our heads; Both distance and size are difficult to judge when you do NOT know information on just one of the parts (and when you have NO IDEA WHAT it is you are looking at), but when the object was closest above our heads, it resembled (in APPARENT size) about an emergency rocket (several of those present talked about that... (which everyone knew at the same time was completely and utterly out of the question... of course!!)). It was orange with a distinct &quot;ball-like shape&quot;. MYSELF perceived it as being a bit &quot;woolly&quot; (blurry) at the edge...but with a clear shape. The object did not blink in any way and had no other colors of light... other than this orange &quot;solid, saturated&quot; light... There was absolutely no sound! It flew in a straight line from approx. east - south - east, and towards approx. west - north - west. As it moved away to the west, it became more apparent that it WAS very far up in the sky...it was getting smaller and smaller, and although the speed was reminiscent of something that might be compared to a regular airplane&#39;s, it took several minutes before it started to go out of sight... (before that finally happened, however, it disappeared rather suddenly... and came back a bit... and then disappeared completely!! - mysterious!!). By the way...it was windless and completely clear and cloudless!! We were a LOT of independents (about 30 - 50, aged about 18 - 50!) who saw this mysterious object, and MY take was - CLEARLY - everyone gaping and looking in amazement and talking about HOW strange it was ...and people asked each other what time it was &quot;this definitely needs to be reported&quot;... &quot;it&#39;s too weird&quot;... &quot;a real UFO&quot;...etc...!! It looked absolutely nothing like anything we are used to being able to observe in the sky... we had not seen anything like it before...!!!! ....It WAS real... and we were many witnesses...!!",

Was probably approx. 500 meters up (my best guess) and they flew next to each other with 100-200 meters between them. When they were past my garden, but still within my field of vision, they flew towards each other, switching positions as to who was flying farthest east and who was flying farthest west. They flew at a fairly high speed and there was absolutely no sound from them. Just 5 minutes later, two planes came into view. One came from the northwest and one from the east, they flew higher up and you could hear them clearly. Planes occasionally fly over my property, but often higher up. I don&#39;t know if it was just a coincidence that they should come now, but it was funny. I don&#39;t think it could have been drones, as they flew reasonably fast and there was no mouse, but whatever it could have been, well...",

I often look out at the water, but this time something quite unusual popped up over the Roskilde area.. It came out of nowhere, probably flew what corresponds to 200 meters, and now comes the reason why I am writing this report.. I stand looking right at it, and it continues quietly and calmly pace, and with a snap it became invisible.. I wondered a lot, and tried to find it with binoculars, it was just gone.. Because the direction and height it flew in, it is impossible that it could fly out of sight behind the horizon, or behind forests/city or other things.. I would describe the object as oblong and gray metallic, and considering the distance it was very large.. See often scheduled flights in the same area, and they are not even half the size..!",

However, the object was too large to be a normal shooting star, the light was woolly-yellowish, and did not trail any tail. Also, it was moving slower than a shooting star, but still fast. The object first moved down towards the western horizon, but the course suddenly &quot;broke&quot; towards the west-southwest horizon, after which it disappeared behind some clouds/haze on the horizon. I must honestly confess that I dismissed it a bit because I had seen a similar object in August. So I thought maybe my eyes were teasing me a little too much here at the end.",

When I spotted a bright dot coming from the Sjællandsbroen side of the Sjællandsbroen flying in the same direction as the road, but a little above the town and towards Amager. I told the wife it couldn&#39;t be a plane as it had no flashing lights so if it was a UFO she should get the video camera out She was reluctant and tired but it only lasted that moment as she couldn&#39;t really see either some flash. Our oldest looked out of the sunroof and decided it wasn&#39;t a real airplane. It was flying slower now and was out over the harbor, maybe over downtown. Just after the bridge flap on the bridge itself I drove in and out we jumped, our three children stayed in the car but looked out. I tried to film it but only got a tiny dot, a brief moment, which could be anything. A couple of fishermen down by the water saw it too and hoped I could see it better. It was approximately 20 degrees to the right of us, perhaps above Amager. It kind of backed up and back a few times, like a car that couldn&#39;t turn in a narrow place, before it slowly flew over Copenhagen and disappeared in the clouds about 15 degrees to the left of the bridge. The size was a little bigger than an airplane that has landing lights on, but it was the same light, even though it was flying in different directions, there was maybe a slight pulsation, the light was slightly orange.",

I live on the fourth floor and have a great view of the sky on both sides of my house! It reminded me at first of the paper balloons with a small light in them that are sent up in the East on certain occasions. However, I found out that it wasn&#39;t! There was a total of approx. 20 pieces, unfortunately I didn&#39;t count them. I was far too busy pacing back and forth in my apartment to watch them appear in the southwest and disappear in the northeast in a light cloud cover there. Pretty quickly I remembered that I had a pair of bird binoculars lying around of pretty good quality. I found it and pointed it at one of the objects and was thus able to observe that the objects consisted of a circle that moved as if on edge, and in this circle there were a lot of glowing points that almost looked like light bulbs that were lit, however, the light was much stronger! At approx. 00:29 it was over, no more came!! A very unique experience and it looked very beautiful! I wonder what it was?",

        "content": "I am sitting with my mother in front of the Culture House on Iceland&#39;s brygge, and at is 12.50. We get a cup of coffee and sit and look at the seagulls in the sky. Suddenly I spot (again) a group of bright spots in the sky. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t wear glasses, but my mother does and counts the spots up to 15 pieces. Is there anything here that repeats itself? PS I can easily see the objects, but with my mother&#39;s glasses on, they were sharp in the sky until they disappeared. We sit and follow the objects, which are moving at a good speed towards us from the Nordhavnen and towards Islands Brygge in a straight line with the harbour, - and see that at a very high altitude they disappear further and further away from where they eventually disappear from sight. The objects are far away and very high up. My mother describes it as at flying height, and I mean it too, and possibly higher? They are luminous, and a bit light blue in colour. I notice which way the clouds are moving in relation to the objects, and it is not the same way!! I have told my mother about the last time I saw similar objects in the sky, so it was really nice to be able to share the experience with another person. After the objects disappeared upwards (notice they were coming towards us and therefore should become more and more visible) and disappeared, of course we sat and looked further to see if more came. It did! At 13.07 2 objects of approx. same place far far away. They followed the same path and disappeared approx. where the large group disappeared. Now we got a little excited, to say the least, and my mother joked that now more would probably come, after approx. 20 minutes. Believe it or not, but in exactly the same place at 13.21 2 more appeared. They followed the same pattern, and you could really sense that they were bright and almost neon blue.. Now we are out in balloon considerations again, I know, but come on!! 15 objects as last, and not! same way as the wind blew, as well as that they kept a good speed, and disappeared out of, even though they were coming towards us, - and therefore should become more visible, if you otherwise know a little about perspective and size ratio... I don&#39;t know, but balloons , birds etc. it just can&#39;t be!! What are the chances that someone once again sends up 15 balloons, which by the way are insanely high up and flying against the wind, and apparently disappear out of, is random?? In any case, I think regardless of the outcome, it is my duty to report what I/we saw, and at the same time I am really happy that others besides me have shared the experience.. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t have a camera with me, and I don&#39;t know either Has it made a difference? Since, like last time, they will only appear as spots/balls.. As a small side note, my mother called right after she had returned home to herself, on Tagensvej. Just looking out in the same direction before she puts the key in the door, she sees God help me 3 more. It is at 15.53.. She says, as she also mentioned to me earlier, that they were triangular!! (I did not write that in the report). I couldn&#39;t see it myself at Iceland&#39;s wharf.. But she was also wearing glasses..",

We estimate these to have been about 3 diameters/each of these... The distance was the same between these all the time, and suddenly all 3 slowly shut off at the same time and they were gone... We thought that maybe could be very large balloons?... but they wouldn&#39;t be able to be extinguished 100% at the same time, we think... I wonder if others have seen the same thing!!!",

        "content": "One summer evening in Skovshoved Harbour, I see an object coming towards the ground at high speed. Since we can see the approach to Kastrup, I think it could be toilet waste thrown from a plane, as there were some stories about this in that period. But as it gets closer, I see that it is a diamond-shaped, steel-gray object that rotates completely silently on its own axis. When it reaches a certain height (50-100 m, and probably the same from the port), it stops falling, and begins to move back and forth between north and south directions, still rotating on its own axis. This is also observed by some anglers, but these speak Polish/Russian, so we don&#39;t get to communicate in any other way than pointing to the object. A couple of planes come in for landing at Kastrup, and then the object starts to vibrate in addition, as if it is &quot;disturbed&quot; by the planes, after which the shaking stops when the planes come a little distance. The object lingers longer and it begins to darken. I go to a phone booth (this was long before the cell phone, after all) to, in my excitement about this, ask with the information if there is a place for reporting UFOs, (I think there was then), but only get the number for the UFO- jeans - comical but unfortunate. When I go back, the object is still there. Being the relatively reasonable teenager that I was, I had to go home at the appointed time, knowing that an excuse that I saw a UFO would not be enough of an explanation for coming home late. I cycle home, somewhat affected by the experience. I cannot give more detailed data than - compass direction etc. than what I have described. It was like nothing I&#39;ve seen before or since.",

They moved fairly quickly one at a time across the sky with a certain distance between them.. There were probably about 10-14 lights (white lights) one after the other without counting them well enough. At first we thought it was helicopters but couldn&#39;t hear a sound even though it was a calm and clear evening. They disappeared like a candle-wick smoldering away.. The company came up with several possible bids, but has not been able to confirm whether it has also been one of these.. i.a. that it should be weather balloons, but why so many, and why with lights on.. someone thought that there were also short flashes of green/red light flashes.. but it wasn&#39;t planes, they don&#39;t come that close on eachother. We also didn&#39;t think it could be gliders, not that many at all and then at night.. as far as I know gliders also fly more in bird flight paths, and not quite as precisely straight lines as these objects. Unfortunately, I am not that well known in Ishøj, so I can give a direction, but they came in a tail after another, one white light per &quot;object&quot;, and they came in approx. 2 - to me - straight lines.. and with a roughly equal interval between them. Didn&#39;t seem like a practice flight either. Hope possibly through this to have the veil lifted as to what it was that we saw last night. Several people in the company had a military background, and they did not have any qualified guesses about the phenomenon. Can&#39;t remember the exact time, but think it was in approx. Half an hour between 22:30 and 23..",

We then see strongly flashing, slow-flying object with characteristic &quot;light formation&quot; moving at an uneven pace over our house, where the object stops and hangs in the air. It is difficult to judge distance, but the object is perceived as large and brings to mind both pinball machines and Star Wars. We view the object from our illuminated courtyard. My husband photographs the object with his iPhone, and when the phone comes out, the object flies away in a south-southeast direction across the forest. As we will see the image afterwards, it is completely white and without a trace of the object. For the sake of comparison, we took one more picture this evening in the same direction, and the picture shows the dark sky and part of our house.",

What jumped out at me was that there was no sound, and there was no tail either. (Like something burning) but a very bright golden light gliding across the sky. The funny thing is if it&#39;s raining and it&#39;s cloudy, then it would be something burning, it would slowly go out, and if it was an airplane, there would be some kind of engine noise or some flashing light , as the clouds hang fairly low when it rains. Now comes the strangest part. Five minutes after the first sighting, a similar one appears in the same straight line as the first, but it is followed by a third in the same straight path as the previous two. When I discovered number 2, I called my wife and asked if she could go outside and look up at the sky and tell me what she saw. (Just so I wasn&#39;t imagining things), but she saw the same as me, although not the first, but the last 2. We tried to take some pictures, but they didn&#39;t turn out that well, but you can tell.",

When I look up at the starry, cloudless sky, I first think I see a shooting star, but in the same second realize that there are several &quot;stars&quot;, all speeding away at a furious speed in a straight course and unchanged V- form across our house. In the V-shape there is a &quot;star&quot; at the tip and 3-4 &quot;stars&quot; on each side of the V-shape. Behind the V-shape follows a single &quot;star&quot; which moves at the same furious speed as the &quot;stars&quot; in front, but in a safe slalom-like course. There was no sound, and in a few seconds the lights &quot;went out&quot; - not all at once - but as if the lights were being gradually, rapidly dimmed, starting with the front ones and towards the back ones, as if they were flying in behind a cloud - but it was cloudless around them, so you could see the surrounding, stationary stars. I was so surprised by the sighting that I exclaimed &quot;What is that?&quot;, causing my husband to see the whole thing as well. While we were still speechless back on the road, we called the family we had just visited and told them what we had seen. We stood looking up at the sky to see if there were any more bright &quot;stars&quot;, while the family asked if it could have been birds - but unless birds have started flying with turbo engines and white headlights as bright as stars, we could immediately rule out that it was birds we had just seen!

        "content": "Around 22.00 the time of approx. 12 years ago, I was driving home from my son and daughter-in-law, who then lived in Agtrup near Kolding. I am driving with my two dogs towards Kolding, it was dusk, not quite dark yet, the weather was completely cloudless, over the horizon lay a faint pink daylight, it was too bright for a star to be seen so clearly. As I get clear of a row of trees, I see to my left a bright, I think, star, - unusually bright white light, but not enough with what it was moving, - almost dancing, just above the treetops. I have become curious about it and allow myself to be tempted to drive up a country road, where I had a better view. To my astonishment, it lowered itself even as I drove up to get a better look - it was right on the edge no matter how high I got up. Here I lasted about five minutes. It just danced, and moved from side to side, quite a lot, actually got smaller. I felt it recede, so I doubted whether it was a star, it had now become a little more dim in the evening light. I got a bit nervous/scared, turned the car around and drove towards Kolding. Here I experienced being followed, slowly as quietly it followed me. It was my intention to get out of the car and try to stop others who were driving in order to confirm my observations. However, I had become so nervous that I continued my drive, slowly, and kept following it on my left. I followed it up over the high-rises, and in the middle of the houses came a bright streak of light, not what you would perceive as a light from a helicopter, it was like the light came from the ground and slowly hit a point on the observed light/phenomenon, which now stood completely quiet in the middle of the high-rise buildings. I got all the way to Kolding, where I had to turn right, so that I got the phenomenon behind me. Here I decided to drive to a place where I could see over most of Kolding to the south. When I reached my decision point, there was nothing, nothing at all, the sky was devoid of anything resembling it. I should note that I had my car window rolled down for a brief moment while I was driving on Skamlingsvejen and where I stopped for a very small moment. There was no noise! - no noise at all! I was scared, I was curious, but I was actually shaking all over. The dogs were calm! A long time later I was on an errand with Egon Petersen, who I knew was interested in UFOs. He had a business in Kolding. Talked to him about what I had seen. I didn&#39;t dare tell anyone else. Egon said it was a daily occurrence for him, it was something that happened all the time. Just writing about my experience makes me feel the excitement. Somehow the event has done something to me, a deep impression and to this day I am sad, I was so scared, it was so close to me and I don&#39;t understand there is no one else who have observed it. It could be a star, which I also thought at first, but this one was moving, so it was easy to dismiss it. Basically, it has been good to be allowed to tell my experience. I have often had my doubts, but it runs like a movie on my retina when I think about it, I think I myself have observed something that was different.",

At the top of the object you can see mist of some kind being emitted. And it&#39;s like there&#39;s a ring of mist around the object too, most evident at the bottom. I did not notice the object when I was filming, unfortunately only 7 years later I discovered this.

The luminous objects came in 2 groups while we observed them - and talked to 2 people jokingly that it was strange enough and that we were probably being invaded. I contacted the police on 114 to see if they knew anything, which they didn&#39;t. The person concerned asked if it could not be laser light, and in any case it was not. I tried to take two pictures with my mobile phone, but they were not clear because of the light from the house. I am happy to send the beetles by SMS if there is interest.",

        "content": "One summer morning, the weather was really good, I stood out on our east-facing terrace and looked in the north/east direction, the sky was completely clear and there was no wind at all. Suddenly I see something slowly flying from west to east. It is a relatively small object which corresponds very well to the description given in the article, it most resembled a flying refrigerator lying down, and it actually had some things sticking out at both ends. At first I think it&#39;s a balloon, but since there&#39;s no wind, it&#39;s moving too fast and far, far too steady to be anything like a balloon. It flew almost as if it were on rails, which a balloon doesn&#39;t do. Could it be a remote-controlled plane of some kind? No! Because there was no sound at all from it, and the hum that a remote-controlled engine makes can be heard far away. I think it was moving at 30-40 kilometers an hour and it flew right over some blocks of flats which are about 60 meters from our house so it was quite close to where I was standing and therefore I am quite sure what i saw matches my description. It has been up to a height equivalent to 10-20 meters above the roof ridge of the blocks, and the blocks are 4-storey standard blocks from the 60s. I follow the object and see that it is flying in the direction of the center of Køge, and here it is that I think that if it has continued on that course, approximately north/east, then it will end up in Copenhagen at some point. I have never forgotten what I saw, but I have also never seen the object again, however I do know that there have been people over in the blocks of flats that it flew over who have experienced a strong light beamed into their windows late in the evening, and those reports are about 10-12 years back in time, and I remember that there was a lot of talk about that/that light in the neighborhood that summer. About 10-12 years ago, I also saw some lights over Køge bay, for which I also have no explanation. I stand one evening at 9-10pm outside our front door, which faces south. It is completely starry, and it has also been during the summer period. I look at the stars and see one of them start to move slowly to the north/east, it could easily be a satellite, I think, but a few seconds later, another star starts to follow the first, and then my serious attention. And believe it or not, a few seconds after the first 2 start moving, they were completely still to start with, then first a 3 and then a 4 start moving after the first in the same direction, and there are now 4 stars flying in a straight line one after the other to the north/east. It should be said that our house is right under an approach route to the airport, so I see a lot of different planes every day and night all year round, but these 4 objects simply could not have been planes or helicopters and certainly not those Chinese hot air bags, it has become so popular to send up. I have not seen anything like it since then, and therefore I remember it as clearly as if it were yesterday.",

As I have my nose to the south, and look approx. 80 degrees up in the sky, I see that there is a white light that passes for about 1-1.5 seconds. At 2 second intervals the same white light comes passing again. Exactly the same place for the same amount of time, same direction. Then 2 seconds pass, and another one comes, exactly in the same place. And it happens a total of 4 times from what I saw. I can&#39;t say if more came before I spotted it. It appeared to be something flying into the atmosphere or like 4 missiles being fired. Shooting stars do not come 4 times in the same place at equal intervals. Neither do meteorites. It did not flash like airplanes nor did it have the same color light as the above. Nor were they satellites, as they do not fly in such a column. I&#39;m pretty sure it was something from outer space that came in or something that went out there. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.",

Discovering a bright spot in the sky, at first I would have thought it was a plane, but not this time. (the speed catches my eye). The object comes from the southeast and moves at a speed of approx. 6 - 7 times faster than a passenger plane can perform. I assume the height to be 10 - 20 km, probably higher. No sound or condensation streaks and moves from one part of the horizon to the other in approx. 10-15 seconds. Impressive. I find it hard to believe that it is a plane, but a natural explanation could perhaps be a smaller asteroid that has passed quite close to the earth and has been so illuminated that you could see it even in broad daylight.",

        "content": "At the time of observation, I lived on a protected farm in Sorø. I often stood and smoked a cigarette by the 400 m long driveway. From this place, at night I had gotten used to seeing the bright lights of passing cars when they came over the hill by Susåen heading from Næstved to Susåen. The property has an unobstructed view down to Susåen to the south, and to Næstvedvej over the neighboring farm&#39;s fields to the west, and the forest that borders the property to the east. At the time, the neighbor had a spruce plantation on the north side. Apart from the lights of the cars and the lighting of the house, there was no lighting from either the road or the nearby towns. I also don&#39;t remember the moon being visible that night, but am suddenly blinded by a very strong white light, which I first assume to be from the high beams of a car coming up the driveway. I clearly remember my wonder at who could think of visiting us unannounced so late in the day. The light very quickly became more powerful than anything I had seen early on! Only when I noticed that the light source was rising up instead of following the long driveway did it dawn on me that something special was going on. From a height of 0 degrees, the light source rose to approx. 45 degrees... Then the light went out as suddenly as it appeared. A few seconds passed before my eyes could make out anything in the darkness. What I now saw was a strange diffuse lighting, in the same place where the strong light went out. In this diffuse illumination, I saw an oval object bathed in a dim, pale green light. The light was NOT coming from the oval object in the air, it seemed more like it was coming from the surrounding air! I shouted and told my boyfriend, who was inside the living room, to hurry out. Perhaps a minute had passed since the light &quot;turned on&quot;. My gaze did not leave the oval, floating and silent object. I could even decipher several different rectangular zones on the oval surface which was a large part of my field of vision.",

When I looked up I saw a red/pink neon glowing object shaped like two deep saucers with the deep side facing each other. All around the vessel there was red lightning that looked like it was standing still. The air around the craft was also red and pink, and if I took a pencil and held it horizontally at outstretched arm and measured the craft, it would be approx. 10 cm wide from my point of view. For comparison, an airplane would be 4 millimeters long using the same measurement method. The object was completely still, and the lightning bolts projecting from it appeared to be cut out of cardboard. They neither changed nor changed form. Therefore, I actually thought it was a figure made with laser light to trick people into thinking they were seeing a UFO. But below the craft it was completely dark, and there was no light from the ground. This is how it stood for approx. 15 sec. It must have been between 3 and 8 km high, because my impression was that it was far away and high up, although it was quite clear in outline. Then it flew suddenly and 100 times as fast as a plane to the southeast for approx. 10 seconds before it disappeared behind the roof of the buildings on the other side of Ingerslev Boulevard in Aarhus C. As it flew, there were still these static red lightning around it. I have never seen anything like that.",

There was no sound, but it can also due to the distance. I quickly went inside to wake my mother, who reached out and saw 2 lights disappearing 120 degrees S.E. A shocking experience. What is it???",

At first thought shooting star but as it neared .. the end.. I could clearly see fire and tail .. a total of 2 - 3 seconds.. before it disappeared behind the ridge of the neighboring house. I was lucky to have my distance glasses on, which I use when I occasionally look at the stars - so it was razor sharp. A shame I didn&#39;t have my mobile at hand so I could film it.. but it didn&#39;t last long... but I picked it up for the compass.

With 7x50 binoculars, it is possible to see that the lights do not come from an emergency rocket, as there is a clear corpus. It is difficult to determine the distance, which can be several km. One object appears in an arc above the long house, Carls Ro in Rødovre, and disappears down behind it. It only takes 5-6 seconds. I live less than 500 meters from the house, which has 6 floors and my roof is much lower. The second object rises in the sky from south to north higher up and is completely free of the nave. The light from the object dies out quickly. The third object is clearly closer to me and also comes from the north. It continues higher in the sky, and is now apparently moving east. The light from the object is very strong in the binoculars, like looking into a burning oven. The light then becomes dimmer and after 10 sec. the object has disappeared. It should be noted that the objects emitted a characteristic orange/red light, which was identical to the observation I and a witness saw over Kamstrupvej on Saturday 14 July at 22.38.",

        "content": "My husband and I experienced the following one night in June: Around At 3 in the morning I woke up to my dog barking and wanting to go out - he never usually does - so I shuffled out to the garden door and let him out. I stood in the doorway, waiting for him, when my gaze is caught by a cone-shaped blue light, (almost like a flashlight), which turns on and off every second. It was located by a fir tree, and came from below and up. At first I thought it was something I had dreamed, but when I had seen it 4-5 times, I went into the living room and looked out the windows to see if I had gone crazy - but no, it continued! ! I&#39;ll be honest, I thought I&#39;d lost my mind, so I went in and got dressed and went over to the tree - and the light stayed on. The closer I got, the stronger the light. When I had reached almost the edge of the lawn, I agreed with myself that I must have just confirmed that it was not me who was seeing, so I went inside and called my husband. He went out the garden door with us, and we also faced the tree - and sure enough, he also saw the light. We stood and looked at it for a while - and agreed that it was probably a flashlight and some children who were on a night run !! (How stupid can you be, there were no sounds - only lights). We agreed that we could check around the tree in the grass in the morning, as it would have come down... We went to bed and slept the rest of the night. And our dog didn&#39;t react to anything - not even when he was let out. He just stood and looked at the light. The next day my husband went down to check - and there was absolutely no sign of anyone - nothing had been stepped on!! So I&#39;m just thinking - what the heck was that?? Has anyone experienced something similar?? I catch myself looking for the light to this day - and if it comes again, I&#39;ll go all the way there!! Would be grateful if there was a logical explanation for my experiences.",

        "content": "I started looking the night it was announced that there would be a ton of shooting stars in the sky. Can&#39;t remember the exact day, but it must be possible to check. It was in Aug. month 2008. I could see several from my balcony, which faces west towards a rather dark yard in the evening. The following days I looked again to see stars and there was a nice full moon several days in a row and some stars I could see quite clearly. One stood east/west and the other north/west not as high in the sky as other stars, and to my great surprise, they began to move almost in figures of eight. Then a little to the north and then return to the starting point later, it looked like one made circles, then a little to the north, then a little up to return to the starting point again. After 15 min. I went back in. An hour later out again. They were still there. Stood still and suddenly there is a little movement to the north, to return again. I observed this for 4 days in a row, each time they were in the same position. The one time I could clearly see a plane out of kbh. airport, a larger plane flew below one, and then it stood still for a moment. One day it was cloudy and these were the only stars I could see. Subsequently there has been nothing for 3 days. So on Sunday 31/08/2008 I went out to look again, and there they were again in the same position. The one that&#39;s east/west was very clear that Sunday, white, and when I look at it, it&#39;s moving very quickly to the east and actually disappears right away. The other, which is more north-west, on the other hand, it moves very north and back and very high to return again. This took place for 10 min. Then I went back inside. An hour later it was still much more to the north, but still moving back and forth and up and down to the exit lane. At first I thought it was my eyes playing tricks on me, but that Sunday I realized that they were actually moving to return to the starting point east/west. The view from my balcony is in the direction of Avedøreholme - Kalveboderne, and northwest is Brøndby - Glostrup. One day I took my bike and cycled down to the mountain at Åmarken St. at Kalveboderne not far from Hvidovre Harbor at 23 in the evening and stood there on the top looking out over the city lights. It was a full moon, and I could not see them in the positions mentioned before. Could, on the other hand, clearly see kbh. airport and those flying from there. Could even see a helicopter over Bellacenter and that way. I&#39;m sure it was one of those because of the lights flashing red, white and it was stationary. After 20 min. I was about to go down when I see a white star-like thing flying by the gas tower in Valby. It stood still and slowly moved slightly to one side so that it was hidden behind the tower. So forward a bit again. It was low down behind the tower again, then never to be seen again.",

A few seconds after I observe the object in a stationary state, it begins to move due east towards Tissø. Height and speed are continuous. The object is under cloud cover, the sky was still quite bright and there was almost no wind. The object is also silent. Since it has been moving for 3-4 minutes, I can no longer see the red light, but can still follow the black object until it disappears into the horizon. I got a knock on the window and alerted my girlfriend. We are quite familiar with emergency flares, drones with lights, weather balloons, Chinese lanterns etc., but none of us have ever seen anything like this. I recorded 20-25 seconds of video of the object when the red light was still visible, but on the video you cannot see the black part of the object.",

All 5 objects had the same size, color, brightness which was very faint but distinct and speed. The speed was the same as that of a shooting star. The brightness was like the most distant stars. The size was approx. 1 cm., where a star is just a dot. Height is estimated to be a few kilometers. Maybe the same height as a shooting star is seen at. I don&#39;t believe in a natural phenomenon. For that, it was far too coordinated. Paper candles are also not possible. I don&#39;t believe in light reflection either. And above all, I find it hard to believe it&#39;s man-made at that speed. I have seen several times the manned space station and other satellites, which are the same size as stars and move somewhat more slowly despite their 30,000 km/h. If they were comets or space debris, they would be so close that they would break the atmosphere and burn up, lighting up the entire night sky. Like the comet that fell here on the island a few years ago. I find it very difficult to believe that intelligence from outer space is capable of visiting us. But this experience was quite hair-raising. I hope you can use my information, and that you can give an explanation for this somewhat distinctive experience.",

First thought was that it was the light on a mast. But as there are no masts of that size in that direction, I stopped on a side road. Here the luminous object could be clearly seen. It was glowing bright red and moving at a moderate speed to the east. Tried to take a photo of it without success. The object disappeared in the cloud cover in a NE direction. The sight height above ground is estimated at 10-12 degrees. Was out of the car to observe. There was no sound to be heard. The distance has probably been too great. The direction of the observation matches the approach to FSN Karup. However, having lived in the area for many years, I have never seen aircraft display that color on approach. The light was bright red. Not pulsating. The color tone turned slightly orange as the object disappeared into the cloud cover. At the time of observation, there was an even cloud cover in the area. No visible celestial bodies to be seen.",

At first thought it was the moon, but then saw the moon about 45 degrees south. The object appeared approx. half the size of the moon. The shape was the most startling and like no celestial phenomenon: Almost like a drop shape on the head, where respectively the pointed end and the round end are flat. However, the warm white color did not fill the entire shape, but was most pronounced at the outer edge of the phenomenon and then faded inwards to disappear (ie become completely black). This dark center in the object formed a vertical lens, however, with &quot;soft&quot; ends rather than sharp ones. After observing the object for about a minute, I rushed in after my boyfriend. When he was supposed to see &quot;my vision&quot; about a minute later, it was unfortunately gone! So I didn&#39;t get to see where it went :-(",

The weather is very clear, and I keep an eye on the big, beautiful full moon in the west (standing low) and at the same time orientate myself in relation to the traffic. The temperature is 0 degrees. At one point I look straight ahead through the windshield and see two white spots - no other light. Automatically thinks it must be a plane (Billund airport). Looking around - at the moon and then out the windshield and the two lights stay in the same position, which I see several times looking ahead. When I look forward for the fifth or sixth time, suddenly they are no longer there, and there is nothing to be seen in the sky where they had been. I of course looked to see if it had been a plane, if it/they had changed direction, but there was absolutely nothing to see. Nor do two planes usually fly so close to each other. I have subsequently researched how airplanes look with their lights and have come to the conclusion that airplanes don&#39;t look like that at first. The distance between the two white objects can best be described as that there could have been room for two objects between the lights. I really hope someone has a more scientific explanation for the two lights. The size of them will probably correspond to one eighth of the size of the Moon, each light.",

It didn&#39;t seem like the objects were high up, maybe a km, but hard to tell. The weather was completely starry, not a cloud in the sky. Up close, it almost looked like a large hot air balloon completely surrounded by a very orange light. In the center of the phenomenon, what seemed to be the hint of a steel skeleton was seen, in any case, as thin vertical and horizontal black lines. As I said, moved quietly to the southwest, without changing direction or altitude.",

        "content": "I happened to be looking at the starry sky and spotted a star moving across the sky. I followed it intensely with my eyes all the time and did not let it out of sight during the obervation. It first moved from east to northeast, and I saw that at some point it became blurry (probably because the distance increased). Although I could only guess at it now, I kept my eyes on its trajectory, and suddenly I saw it fly at an incredibly high speed back to where it came from more or less, ie. from northeast to east (southeast). So it flew at a steady speed from the east (southeast) towards the northeast, and suddenly it flew back at an INCREDIBLY high speed and had, what I would estimate, a 20 cm long tail behind it. It cannot have been a shooting star, because I never lost sight of the &quot;UFO&quot; (the moving star). If I hadn&#39;t seen it fly slowly first, I would probably have thought it was just a shooting star. At the same time, my older brother saw another bright object in the sky in the same position in the sky (almost) that I saw. He claims that this changed direction. However, it is only my observation that I can comment on here in detail. In fact, after this I saw another &quot;star&quot; moving from northeast to southeast. My father also saw this and he said it was a satellite, but then it suddenly came back, just like the one I had seen before, this one kept a steady speed the whole time, and my father explained it as being a high-flying plane. But it was silent, looked mistakenly like a star, and came DIRECTLY back. Nothing about it having to turn an arc to turn the 180 degrees. The observations are from between 22:35 and 22:48. The first, and to me most inexplicable, I saw approx. 22.38.",

We have been sitting in our cars on old Aarhusvej near Gjesing on a hilltop and watched the 2 objects in the sky for 5-7 minutes. This has now happened three days in a row, where we have seen the two objects in the same place suddenly appear in the sky with a reasonably created light. One object shines more brightly than the other, and today we saw the two objects standing still in the sky for 2-3 minutes, after which they flew at a rapid speed to the southwest. In the direction of Vejle. I am convinced that these are not stars or planes, since yesterday 31-07 we saw exactly the same thing just at a different time (22.23 to 22.40). The 3 of us who observed this took pictures of what we just saw.",

We were standing right by the Chinese tower, I think it&#39;s called. For some reason I look up right where I&#39;m standing and see three very faint lights and it&#39;s closer than you think as we could clearly see below the object which forms a triangle. I quickly say that to the others without taking my eyes off the object. It suddenly moves and exits the triangular formation, and the three lights line up and quietly fly away. We soon lost sight of them as there was a large tree in the way where we stood and could not follow them, but they flew towards the main track. It must be said that they were not very high up, and the second was that their light was very faint, like a clear sensation, like something hiding in the air, and no sound. Immediately difficult to say, as there is a lot of noise in Tivoli, and no it was not a drone (flying with a drone myself), and it was rather not something from Tivoli, and it was definitely not a plane. Before they were completely out of our sight, I took a picture without, I figured something would come into the picture, but it did, although very shaken, but you can see there are 3 lights in a row.",

A faint one to the left, one to the right, a little further down and a distinctive white one.. The white floats down and at the same time turns somewhat off, towards a faint northerly direction, while it becomes weaker, in both brightness and diameter. It takes 2-3 seconds, then it&#39;s gone. 35 degree angle. It might have been the plane, but I doubt it. The light was stronger and there was only one. A shooting star ? they are gone much faster.",

It has been almost 4 months since I saw this strange phenomenon in the sky. I was at work (evening work) and had a break where I talked to a friend on the phone outside. The sky was pretty clear with stars, and when it is, I spend a lot of time looking at it. I have faith that we are not alone at all, and want to see something strange and inexplicable in the sky every day... and it happened on Wednesday, September 16, 2009! It was a kind of ball of light the size of a large star, which came at extremely high speed across the sky, in a zigzag curve, with a slight reduction in speed when it was at the top of the sky, and then extreme acceleration to the south, zigzag end. It might resemble a shooting star, but I have never seen a shooting star that went from approx. 40 degrees from the horizon from the north, to about 30 degrees to the south - and WITHOUT a burning tail that a shooting star would otherwise give off. At the same time, its trajectory in the sky was not quite normal. It wound like a wave across the sky, had a small stop-up, and then continued at tremendous speed. To give a rough picture of how it happened, I will explain it like this: (the figures are fictitious, just to give an idea of the situation).",

It appeared as if the object was dimly lit, as by a luminous night cloud. It was as if it was slightly transparent, or as if we were seeing it through a thin cloud. There were like oval &quot;slats&quot; close to each other, they were bluish. The object maintained constant speed, direction, height and shape. I expected to lose sight of it behind a tall tree, but it disappeared before. When it disappeared, it seemed like it just became invisible. I couldn&#39;t see clouds in that direction either, it was very starry that night. There was no sound at all. If we can get an explanation of what it could be, we will be happy, because it was just too strange to experience. I mean being able to rule out drone, cloud, plane, and flock of birds.",

We had summer holidays from school and it was probably around 10-11pm in the evening. We were a lot of children playing and playing round ball down on the lawn by the block we lived in. Many of our parents were sitting out on the balconies enjoying the evening coffee (I think it was a Friday or Saturday). Far up, like little stars, we can see many, many small red balls flying in and out between each other. We cannot hear a sound. It seems like there are several hundred. We all line up and watch and wonder at this phenomenon. Everyone talks about how it can&#39;t be a plane when we can&#39;t hear anything, and so many can&#39;t fly between each other either. When we have been standing for a while, maybe half an hour, we suddenly hear a whisper to our right. Approx. 200 meters to the right of us there is another 4-storey block. Above this block now comes a huge red ball flying.....the ball seems as tall as the block, i.e. as tall as a high-rise building. It flies as if on its own axis at the same time. that it drives forward at very fast speed. and the only sound we can hear is this hissing. Suddenly it disappears up and out into the sky. In the meantime, it is thinning out in the small red &quot;balls&quot; up in the sky. They are still as small as stars and we cannot hear a sound. Suddenly I see 2 of them coming flying from different directions towards each other. They stop when they reach each other. One ball floats some distance above the other. Suddenly they &quot;melt&quot; together into a ball and fly on. This lasted between 1 and 2 hours before it was all over. We couldn&#39;t see where the balls disappeared, it kind of just thinned out in them. If anyone else has observed this incident, or has heard of others who have seen it, I would very much like to hear more. Does SUFOI possibly have received inquiries about this phenomenon once in the mid-seventies, I am also VERY interested in hearing more about this.",

        "content": "While standing on the balcony (I live on the 14th floor), I observe something to the west. It was two bright orange lights that &quot;turned on and off&quot;. My guess is that they were somewhere above Verløse at an altitude of 2-300 meters. After the two orange lights (2*venus size) alternated on and off, a series (3 to 5), smaller red balls of light were seen rapidly flying in both directions from the orange objects across the night sky and parallel to the horizon above a distance of approx. 8-1200 meters before they disappeared. I had observed this previously, in two rounds in total, with approx. 5 minutes in between before I got the camera going. My guess? two hot air balloons that turn on and off the burner and play with fireworks (although I&#39;ve never seen roman candles, only with red balls, and that glow for so long, or balloons that flew after 10 pm). A passenger and I had just got out of the car at our home address. She asks if I can also see the strange orange light moving across the sky from west to east. I can. As I fumble with my mobile to film, it turns into two lights. The big one and a smaller one. They change direction, the small one flies a little away from the big light, and back to it again. They become one light again, and fly-disappear towards the south. I walk our dogs every evening and take great pleasure in studying the sky during the air walks. I often see satellites flying across the night sky, and there is also the air traffic. But I&#39;ve never seen anything like it tonight.",

No sound, but constant speed from our left to right. Then we see two more come into view flying in exactly the same path and finally a single more following the others a good distance behind. We follow them for 5-10 minutes, until eventually they all fly into a cloud to the northeast, and wait, but they don&#39;t come out the other side. We have never experienced anything like this before and they were flying opposite to the usual planes we see coming from the North Sea towards the airport.

My experience this night started with a bright (sharp) white light illuminating the room where I had just gone to bed. Stayed there as I was in doubt about what I saw. - During approx. For 20-30 seconds, the white light illuminated the room 2-5 times, almost as if someone outside shone in through the window with a sharp searchlight. So bright a light that I wondered if my curtain was still drawn. I got up, went to the window and could now see that the white light &quot;was&quot; over the Baltic Sea, approx. 20-40 km west of Hasle (Bornholm) and approx. 5-15 km south / south-east of Ystad, Sweden. The position was just below the horizon line (or rather where I am at the horizon line - at the time of the observation it was dark over the sea). The white light flashed a few times, so that parts of the Baltic Sea were illuminated, and at one point the light was, as it were, &quot;collected&quot; in a large sphere, which was slightly larger than the full moon. The light was very bright for approx. 10-15 seconds, I decided to find the video camera. But unfortunately the light disappeared when the camera was ready, - the light disappeared behind the horizon. Smaller rays of light, however, continued to shine forth from behind the horizon line. After a total of approx. 10 min there was no more of the white light or small rays. I would like to add that I have seen the Northern Lights in Greenland, - but this white light did not resemble the Northern Lights, perhaps with the exception of the smallest closing rays. Furthermore, it was due west, and ended west / north-west. So today my daughter and I agreed that I must have seen my first UFO.",

Around 18-19/1-12 I drive to our house at 7pm and see a large circular light source orange/yellow coming flying towards my direction of travel. I would guess the light source is approx. 100-150 meters above the ground. At first I think it is a plane, but there is no sound and no other light on it. When I first see it, it is approx. 500 meters from our house. I drive to the house and get out of the car to observe it. It is about 150 meters from our house and 100-150 meters above the ground. There is no sound at all and it moves quietly and smoothly in a smooth motion. When it is approx. 50-80 meters past our house, it stands still for a few seconds and then starts to move out over the water, and then it is as if it accelerates violently for approx. 10 seconds it disappears into nothingness and finally disappears completely. The entire observation lasted approx. 2 minutes For this sighting, I was the only one who saw it - the next one was seen by both me and my wife. This took place on the same day as in Malling - namely on 12/2-12 at around 10 p.m. My wife and I are sitting on the sofa watching TV when Janne (my wife) spots a light approx. 50 meters above the ground around the neighbour&#39;s house. We rush to the window, and then I spot the same light source that I saw around the 18th-19th. January. A glowing circle/ball in orange/yellow. We only observe it for approx. 8-10 seconds before it disappears. So on Tuesday 14/2-12 my wife observes it again. This happens in the evening around 22.25 when she comes home from a visit to her mother. She sees it again when she comes driving towards our house. Again it is above our neighbor&#39;s house hovering from west to east. She rushes in and calls to me, but when we come out together it is gone. I am very interested to hear if anyone else has observed anything similar during this period. The reason I am writing is, among other things, the video on your website and have just read about a person in Hjørrin,g who experienced something similar in January.",

At first I think it&#39;s one of those Chinese lanterns that you can send up. But we quickly agree that it is not, as it is quite large and has a lot of speed. I live close to Billund airport, and there are many airplanes a day here, as the route is around the area. They fly very low and make a lot of noise. So we actually thought it was an airplane that was on fire. But it wasn&#39;t on its way to land, and it wasn&#39;t exactly taking off, as it was way too high up and wasn&#39;t going down or up, then it just held the height. It was completely silent, we couldn&#39;t hear a single sound. We have also not heard of a plane crash. Not many seconds passed. before it was gone and unfortunately we were so amazed by what we saw that we didn&#39;t get to take a picture. I&#39;ve googled everything I can think of that it could be. We mostly think it looked like a comet because it was fiery red! But didn&#39;t it have a &quot;tail&quot; behind it?",

We were 13 years old and waiting for my mother, who was attending evening classes at the school next door. While we stood talking, we looked towards the SE and watched the air traffic around Copenhagen. The weather was clear, and due to the slight rise in the terrain there was a good view. One of these points of light moved out from the city towards the SW; i followed it as it seemed a bit different from the other planes. As the light gradually grew in size, we marveled at the fact that there was only one, steady light, where usually there would be multiple and flashing lights to be seen. It otherwise had the size, speed and height of a normal plane. When the light was approx. SW, we noticed another, identical light coming from the NW at the same height, like a mirror image; it appeared that the &quot;planes&quot; were on a collision course. But just as they looked set to collide just to the west of us - they almost seemed to touch each other when they were closest - they both reversed and flew back exactly as before, but on the opposite course - again like a mirror image . They did not turn immediately, but almost; it probably took a second at most before they had the same speed again. Our only guess was helicopters, but we both found it hard to believe that helicopters were capable of turning so quickly or would make such a risky maneuver, although of course they might be slightly offset to us in the longitudinal plane. In any case, drones did not exist then.",

        "content": "We sat 6 people on 2 benches and looked up at the tower of Saint Petri Church in Copenhagen. We sat right next to the tower and talked about the cone of light from a disco, which in circular motions lit up some light clouds just behind the tower, We joked that it was probably Batman&#39;s. Suddenly we saw a spot of light (like a medium-sized star) travel across the sky and stop – it was only when it stopped that we all really saw it because it seemed so unnatural for something to stop in the sky. The spot of light was still for a second or two, then it made a few strange zig zag movements. Then the devil touched it and it disappeared in a flash. The whole thing only lasted approx. 10 seconds. All 5 of us agreed that it wasn&#39;t from the cone of light, not a satellite (because it moves slowly and only in one direction), not a plane or a helicopter (since they can&#39;t stop, turn and accelerate that fast) nor our imaginations – we all saw it. For the next half hour you alternately looked up at the sky, but the phenomenon did not repeat itself – and that rules out that it could have come from the cone of light from the discotheque nearby. Saturday night at 01:07 the night sky was bright, and there were some quite light clouds through which you could see the stars - but there were no clouds in the whole sky. The reason the last person didn&#39;t see it is because the person wasn&#39;t wearing glasses.",

He does not remember the exact date, but since he was lucky enough to take a short video of the phenomenon with his iPhone, the time is ihf. registered. The film is still in his phone and it is possible that the date will appear if the film is transferred to a computer. Apparently you can&#39;t see the date unless the movie is transferred first. It could be interesting to find out what the film actually shows, and that is the background for this inquiry. My father claims that under no circumstances can it be a plane or a helicopter, and he goes on to say that there was no sound during the entire sequence of events. He has also described to me a yellowish-orange ball that floated rapidly in a SE-NW direction, about a quarter of the size of the Moon when the object was closest. He has not been able to provide details about the object&#39;s distance or height. The experience lasted 1-2 minutes, he guesses, but unfortunately he only managed to film the object for 14 seconds while it was moving away, as he had to go inside to retrieve his iPhone shortly before. We are very excited about whether SUFOI can contribute with an explanation of what it is that my father has seen?",

        "content": "15.04.2007, 21.31 (summer time) I was in Augustenborg looking at the starry sky. In the western part of the sky I saw a constantly bright object moving in an easterly direction at about the same speed as the airliners that frequently fly over this location. I noticed the object because the direction was different from the NE-SW direction that is apparently preferred by the airliners. The glowing object also attracted my attention, because the white light was about the same strength as the domestic scheduled planes use in the future when they approach for landing at Sønderborg Airport from completely different directions, at a lower speed and at a low altitude. This object had no direction from or to Sønderborg Airport, and most importantly: the strong, constant light shone equally brightly as I observed the object from the front, side and rear during the passage, which followed a straight course south of my location me. And I couldn&#39;t see the blinkers or starboard/port lights that planes otherwise use - there was only this white light that obviously shone equally brightly in all directions during the passage. I often observe the sky from this location - day, evening and night, and I am familiar with many different objects in the sky that I can identify as celestial bodies and aircraft. But this object differed in several ways from what I am used to seeing. Therefore, I am now reporting my observation.",

A mix between a loud turbine and a dark hollow rumble. Then turned off the radio and looked out. There was a blanket of clouds over the sky going from west to east. On the horizon was blue sky. Out at the end of the cloud cover (approx. above Frørup or Storebælt) was a circular cloud formation. And out of it flew a luminous object with a luminous tail. It looked like a small comet. It flew at very high speed across the blue sky to the south. I had been up early to take pictures of horses in the morning sun, so luckily my camera was lying on the seat opposite me. I reach for it in a flash, and as I&#39;m about to aim the camera, the object either disappears at the speed of light or just vanishes into thin air. I do a lot of UFO research on my own, so I tried to rule out various possibilities and rationalize. But both the appearance and the speed, the sound and the cloud formation gave me reason to believe it was a UFO I saw. It was all confirmed by the fact that last night and this morning large military helicopters flew around here in the residential area and out around my observation. They flew no more than 80 m above the rooftops. The weather is bad today, but thinking of going out for a drive and seeing if there is any unusual activity in the area today.",

I wrote down the details then, and have kept the paper ever since, so remembering the story hasn&#39;t been a problem. Slept under the open sky on Humlebæk Strand, right next to Louisana, with my girlfriend at the time. I woke up very early from the cold and decided to go for a walk up to the harbor pier at Humlebæk Harbor and watch the sunrise from there. From here there was a view across the strait to Sweden, where Helsingborg lies a little to the north. I sensed that it would be a while before the sun rose, but was determined to enjoy the dawn. I had no watch with me. The weather was good, the sea calm. There was a light breeze and the sky was cloudless, both above and to the east. A little further north of Helsingborg there were some very high, thin hazy clouds. When I looked over towards the harbor area at Helsingborg, I saw that there were two tiny cumulus clouds, greyish in colour, hovering just above each harbor building... silo-like buildings. It immediately struck me as strange that in an otherwise almost cloudless sky, there should be such two small clouds. So I looked at them in the early morning light, and as I looked I could see that they were moving quietly... first towards each other, then away from each other, then in the same direction, as if they were moving independently of whatever wind there may be. It was plain to see as they could be seen in relation to the buildings. However, they stayed above the buildings the whole time. Furthermore, they changed their appearance, from elongated to circular, as if they had turned, and now showed the end profile. And in this circular shape they seemed to be surrounded by a faint green light. Slowly the &quot;clouds&quot; became elongated again, as if they had turned again. Of course I wondered what they could be if they weren&#39;t clouds. I thought it might be about balloons that were attached to some buoy that might be in the water somewhere out in the strait. But I couldn&#39;t connect that with the perspective, which indicated nothing more than that these &quot;clouds&quot; were where they seemed to be. I also thought it might be something to do with warm air, just above the roofs of the silos, forming clouds when it met the cold morning air. But how could they move from side to side? I watched them for about ten minutes, during which they continued to move as described. Then I briefly looked up towards the north, to see if the sun was about to appear (after all, the sun rises high on the horizon at that time of year), which was not the case. When I then looked back to where the &quot;clouds&quot; had been, they were gone. I had looked away for half a second. There is a small footnote. A little later in the morning, after the sun had risen and some of the locals had started coming down to the beach to take their morning dip under the lovely summer blue sky, I was lucky enough to see a meteor burn off. It was like watching a match being lit against the sky... there was a long flame and then a clear cloud of smoke, pretty much right over my head, maybe 50 meters up. It was beautiful. There is an additional footnote, and it is an observation that I made late in the evening of the same day. But I will write about that in a separate report.",

I thought at dusk that it was a hot air balloon and told the elder to roll down the window to look. I stalled the public van and rolled down the window to see for myself.

Of course, it was not an ordinary line, from an airplane. This one was very different, in that it was yellowish, relatively strongly luminous and very thick. As I looked more closely at it, it seemed to me to look very much like a comet, with a ball at the bottom, followed by a tail. However, the tail was wide, as opposed to a stereotypical comet tail that tapers at the end. At first it appeared that the object was standing still, but gradually it became clear to me that it was moving. During the ten minutes I watched it (I dropped the observation when my bus arrived), it moved completely vertically from high in the sky to low over the rooftops. The time should be quite accurate when I looked at the clock on my mobile phone. However, my clock is three minutes too fast compared to teletext&#39;s time. A light in the sky may not sound that alarming, but I cannot stress enough that the phenomenon appeared very surreal and out of place. As the above quote shows, so was the impression it made on the children who saw it. It was unlike any human aircraft or celestial phenomenon I have ever seen (not that I spend much time looking at the sky).",

They moved very quickly and were gone after approx. five seconds. Well... the hairs on the back of my neck haven&#39;t really settled down yet, because it&#39;s not every day you see something like this, but I actually felt like I was in the middle of the movie &quot;Close Encounter of the 3rd Degree&quot;, and the objects actually moved a little likewise, rapid but distinct course changes.",

I thought maybe someone had stolen such a huge machine and was driving around right down the front, so I got up to have a look before I wanted to call the police, because it was very loud! When I looked out the window there was a large triangular flying thing with white lights across its belly. I&#39;m not sure how many, but maybe 6-7 pieces from tail to tip and red lights from wing to wing.. When I was standing and trying to get my phone to work, the plane turned then the tip came slowly towards me. I got so scared that I jumped back into bed and lay there waiting and listening. Then the sound disappeared just like that, then it was gone. I didn&#39;t dare look out of the window and didn&#39;t dare sleep until it got light. I&#39;m still very afraid of it coming back. I really need to hear if anyone else has seen or heard the same thing.

It has a &#39;belt&#39; around the center which is dark grey/black. The cylinder is very clear, it is metallic bright, not chrome plated. It moves silently a little to the right and also to the left - approx. 20 meters each time. Then it takes a trip away from me, approx. 50 meters to return. Here it &quot;dances&quot; a little back and forth with approx. 5 meters away. There is no light or sound... Nothing. It actually looks like an airplane when viewed from above. However, there is no rear end. The most amazing sight my son and I have seen. There were virtually no clouds and it was almost over our heads. Approx. 50 meters from above our head. I would assume the cylinder was 6-7 meters long with a &quot;ribbon&quot; around it. The wings went approx. 2 meters up from the cylinder, and 2 meters down below. The most amazing thing was when it flew away from us, it was like it just &quot;disappeared&quot; in front of us!!! Silently again...",

Unfortunately, I do not know of exact observations, but the cloud cover was quite low. The weather was dark, but the lights of the city could be seen on the low clouds. I see an object sliding from the right through the air. The distance to the object is difficult to judge, perhaps 500-750 meters. It is completely round, and has a diameter in the sky of approx. 4-5 millimeters. It glides at a constant speed (about 250 km/h, estimated) and the entire object glows with a constant orange-yellow light. I immediately alert the other three to the object. We talk about what it is - one thinks it is a satellite, but it is several times larger than the satellites you usually see. Furthermore, we will later talk about the object flying under cloud cover, and thus it is not a satellite. The object is at no time in contact with the clouds, and is clearly visible until it disappears behind rooftops. At first glance, it would be reasonable to write the object off as being a large balloon of some sort, but it was very brightly luminous. It&#39;s hard to say what it could be.",

There came approx. 20 (not counted) silent objects flying slowly to the south, they were within the atmosphere, actually not that high up. - We do not know about your degree system, so we cannot specify that. They flew over Bagsværd Sø, came from the Furesø area (north) and flew slowly south. We were at the end of Søvej, Bagsværd. At first we thought it must be someone who had sent up a lot of balloons, but they flew much faster. They formed formations and stood still in between and flew on to eventually get smaller and disappear (to the south). The objects were bright orange-red - partly round. Can draw the shape, but your report can&#39;t... A bit like a jellyfish shape - flat on the sides, but round in the middle. They were very luminous, floating, floating, calm, all facing the same direction. They did not change direction at any time, other than the front ones formed - in a fluid movement a kind of formation that could look like a constellation. We called 118 twice to get the phone number for SUFOI, but they gave the wrong number both times. So the embedding only takes 45 minutes. later. Can you tell us if you know of a natural explanation, perhaps from other people&#39;s observations, we would very, very much like an explanation, please send an e-mail or call the contact information provided.",

We took 4 selfie photos approx. next to the camels seen in an east direction with Frederiksberg castle in the background and with the Zoo tower on the right in the selfie pictures. In the first picture, a purple square &quot;UFO&quot; can be seen. A little behind you can see a small &quot;ufo&quot; more, but hard to see from the poor selfie image quality. Is there exhaust gas? to the west of &quot;ufo&quot;. In selfie picture 2 is exhaust gas? almost obliterated, but can be seen. In the last pictures, there is quite a bit to the left of the &quot;ufo&quot;. In all 4 pictures, the &quot;ufo&quot; hangs at the same height, slightly above the height of the Frederiksberg castle flag. &quot;Ufo&quot; has approx. same size as the flag at the Castle. The 4 photos were taken during approx. 10 sec. We did not hear any &quot;UFO&quot; sounds. But there was a really good atmosphere from the many happy people who were in the Zoo and saw all the animals. Don&#39;t know if there were some of them who also noticed the &quot;ufo&quot;.",

When we walked on the path home, (located in an open field), we had a beautiful view of the total clear starry sky. We could see 360 degrees around with a clear view of the sky. We went and looked at stars and airplanes, which we talked about a bit. There were lots of flashing lights, red and white. They were airplanes, we were aware of that. But then an object appeared almost sailing across the sky. It looked very strange, a bit like an airplane flying high. Maybe it was just turning in its orbit, but I&#39;ve never seen an airplane this close before at this point. There was a red flashing light at the top, and a good distance below was a white one, and in between, there was also something flashing. Then there was a white light running across what I assume was the &quot;belly&quot; of the object. If it was an airplane turning, then it could be a red light on one wing tip and a light in the middle and a white light on the other wing tip and then a white light running across the &quot;belly&quot; itself. It just seemed like there was no tail on. Here I am thinking of an airplane. It took a long time before it was out of sight. We stood still and looked for it, then walked a little and stopped and looked again, it was still in sight. Very slowly it disappeared to the west. There were no sounds to be heard. From the time we saw it until it was out of sight, it was still flying &quot;high&quot;.",

The object came approx. from VNV in the direction of Copenhagen. As the flight routes go directly over Birkerød, I immediately thought that there was a fire in a scheduled plane on its way to the airport, but when a few seconds later another object appeared in the same direction, I concluded that it was possibly some balloons with this light, as there was no sound that the planes emit. As the objects moved at great speed and furthermore (approx. above Farum) made a turn of approx. 90 degrees and with great speed disappeared into the horizon in the SSW direction, it must have been another kind of flying object. - Today I investigated more closely what it could be, and my conclusion, based on pictures and reports from the internet, must be the same as what others have experienced under the term UFO. Since I can&#39;t find any other reports, which makes me wonder, I&#39;m posting mine for your convenience.",

I first assume it&#39;s an airplane and the shape is an optical illusion due to the angle, but since the object continues at &quot;airplane speed&quot; (the speed doesn&#39;t seem particularly high or low compared to an airplane), the shape remains the same. Sharp at the edges, with a smooth transition to a thicker hull in the middle. The object has no blinkers or lights, which is why I rule it out as a plane, and the object disappears behind a cloud formation.",

I sit and observe them for a while when out of the blue two of them disappear! I ran out to film them, but immediately you can&#39;t see them on film. I stood for almost 1 minute on the terrace and watched the last two disappear over Lake Brabrandsøen and into the horizon. At first glance I thought they were flares, but they moved horizontally and very quickly in formation until two of them disappeared. It was a steady red light that didn&#39;t blink. They didn&#39;t fly very high and didn&#39;t make a sound - I&#39;m curious if you guys got any other calls since they were visible for almost 2 minutes?",

I shop at private shops that have stalls along the road, and I shopped at a shop a bit out of the way. My car sat idle while I found what I wanted and put it in the car. It was really nice to shop, even though it was raining and the sky was completely gray covered with clouds as far as you could see, - it still smells like spring. When I finished, I sat in the car, which was idling - and drove. I drive maybe 15-20 metres, then the car stalls, the windscreen wipers and radio stop, and the car is totally dead. Something I would hate to be stranded in No Where with my autistic son on a Sunday night. I try to revive the car but it is dead.. I turn on the ignition and try to start the radio to calm my son. It doesn&#39;t work, I try the wipers - doesn&#39;t work. Maybe - eight, five minutes in all - the car is dead and it&#39;s getting dark. Suddenly the wipers and radio start again - there is a light on the car and it starts as if nothing had happened. Confused but happy, I turn the car around and drive down the road, at the crossroads I casually look at the sky, which is gray all over - no clarification anywhere. There I see a pink splash in the grey, to the south - at an angle of between 70 and 90 degrees. I take my phone and get it ready to film, but I have to move the car away from the intersection where I stopped.. I drive a few 100 m and want to take a photo - but the pink stain is gone, and everything was gray in gray again.",

At first they seemed to be followed across the sky, but some lights &quot;ran away&quot; from the others. They made no sound. They were fairly far out on the horizon and the lights seemed small, so my guess is that they were a few km above the surface of the earth without being able to say it more precisely. The lights were steady - not flashing - and were white/slightly yellowish. They did not seem to be constant in their movements, as they could move a little &quot;confused&quot; around the sky, and against the direction of the clouds. I have recorded a video that I would like to send you where you can see them. It was recorded on a camera phone, so the quality is accordingly.",

        "content": "We were watching the fireworks when Søren pointed out that he had seen something. I directed my gaze there and saw a white spot, and after about 10 minutes of observation, it halved its light emission and flew in a small circle, followed by a kind of cross (a circle and a cross of about 2 cm diameter in front of the naked eye) . We decided this needed more investigation and so picked up binoculars. Since Søren uses glasses, it was me who initially used the binoculars. He engaged my observations later. When looking at the spot through binoculars, it had grown to twice its size (which should rule out a star, and this was not due to increased radiance). It was very strange, so we decided to go in because we might be shaking our hands. Approximately 4 minutes pass from the time we entered until we resume the observations. By this time it had almost halved its radiance by 75%, (we concluded it was not due to the clouds as it was perfectly starry.) During its faint radiance it resumed its movements. We continued to observe it for about 50 minutes during which it did its fade and movement number. Several times, when it completely dimmed its radiance, through the binoculars you could quite clearly see 3 lights below it and a round underside. The velocity was estimated to be approximately three times the velocity of the stationary stars. It couldn&#39;t be space debris as this wouldn&#39;t be moving back and forth, this shouldn&#39;t be a satellite either as this shouldn&#39;t be moving either. We can only conclude that it is an object which is trying to masquerade as a star, but still cannot do so. The observation was made in a completely sober state, by Ole O. and Søren RF, as well as Ole&#39;s parents and a few guests. (the guests were not sober though) With a little good will, the object bears some resemblance to the objects that were observed in the Netherlands (the triangular ones with three lights, can&#39;t remember when it was) However, this one is just a bit further away. It is now 01:40 and we continue our observations.",

Since I have been out in the garden for approx. 8-9 min., 5 bright dots appear in the sky directly above my head. They come in a south-west direction and fly north-east, the 4 in a straight line with the same mutual distance, the 5 in the same direction, approx. between no. 2 and 3 and on the left side of the row with the 4. The break-in distance between 1 - 4 was the same and no. 5 approx. at double distance out to the left. I have seen many satellites and planes, we live on the approach route to Billund. They came as 5 satellites at a fairly high speed and disappeared as satellites usually do, they got fainter and fainter. There was no sound. I stood out there for approx. 10 more minutes. Since I wear glasses I looked up and saw them and thought what the heck is that. I look away and look up again and they were still there, also no visible flashes like from airplanes. If my eyes are not deceiving me, they immediately looked to be very high up, birds do not usually fly with such a precise distance between themselves. The color was faint white/yellow like sunlight on satellites.",

Sonnerup), where I first see a reddish object in the sky NW direction approx. 30 degrees above the horizon, which I thought was an emergency rocket from a boat in distress on the ice fjord. In addition, two reddish objects appeared. They form a 1/4 of a circle. At this point I turn north on highway 53 which goes to Fredriksund and can see them start to take a different course, but am disturbed by a small forest (beach forest) first. when I have come 2/3 of the way through the forest, I can see that they have changed direction and are now above another forest (ryes forest) N-E direction approx. 25/30 degrees above the horizon. I am now completely free of the forest and can see that now there are only two left, and they are on their way out across the Isefjord again. They now begin to turn on and off alternately and at the same time move vertically and move north. I then follow them all the way to Ejby, where my son is with some friends, where I pick him up. When he comes out to the car I show him them. And we drive out where we can have a clear view. We follow them as long as they are in heaven. They then disappear in a northerly direction. I will use my son&#39;s expression for this experience: SOUR!!!!!!",

The object came closer and, in my estimation, at that time was around Sengeløse village. I went out into the backyard and at approx. 90 seconds the object had dropped horizontally from 60 to 20 degrees from my point of observation. It slowed down and hovered over a neighboring house approx. 15 meters away. I could hear a sound from the object which I identified as a low hum. I flashed my lighter to signal and it came approx. 5 meters closer. Then it stopped and the sound disappeared. From approx. 20 meters high, the object stood still above me for approx. 60 seconds and then disappeared back to the north. When the vessel had come some distance, it began to flash white and blue lights. Reminiscent a lot of ordinary signal lights from airplanes. It then disappeared above the tree line, but I could see the lights through the woods. I estimate the object to be approx. 120x80. The sound of the craft died away as it stood still. It is probably drone activity, but I find the lack of sound suspicious. Hence this observation.",

(However, there were no stars in the sky this evening). These 3 luminous objects were positioned as a triangle in the sky. While I sit and look up, they start to move around in a strange circular way, where shortly after they gather again in less than 1 second. My friend looks up, and I point and explain, after which they disappear, like the lamps being turned off. It should be said that I hadn&#39;t been drinking this evening, as I work during the festival and had to be on duty at 00.00. The reason I&#39;m writing to you is, of course, that I&#39;m wondering, and especially because it wasn&#39;t long ago that I had seen &quot;paranormal investigators - hoax or fact&quot; on TV3, where they showed footage and pictures of 3 luminous objects in the sky, also positioned as a triangle, exactly the same as those I saw. However, these observations had been discovered in the United States. I&#39;m hoping to find an answer from you, or possibly that you might have some pictures lying around of something similar? Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t manage to take a photo of these 3 glowing objects myself, as I was so shocked that I couldn&#39;t concentrate on anything other than looking at them, which I regret now. It&#39;s not the first time I see inexplicable things in the sky, it must be said, the last time I saw something it was more clear, a flying object in the sky, shaped like a saucer, where the center was dark and the outside was bright, it happened on Oddervej between Malling and Odder last year, and I have 2 witnesses to this.",

It is warm and has the window open. I wake up to a deafening noise, and I look out of the window (you&#39;re curious, after all!), and only see an object coming in from the NE, but immediately only see the lights red and white in fixed patterns and then the noise! I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a helicopter. I guess it is on the other side of the &quot;City Hill&quot;, approx. 200-30 0m from me. I hear my wife get up and go to the bathroom and I wonder if I should say something to her! She will usually reply that: You can read about that in the newspaper tomorrow, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. I am convinced that there is someone who is sick and needs to go to the hospital quickly. The helicopter lands, the rotors stop and eventually the engine stops too. It&#39;s quiet again, but I can clearly hear people talking! I sat and watched the whole thing (even though I could see nothing) and was sure I could get the report later from him who lives in No. 3. He otherwise never lets the chance pass when there is an opportunity. Great was my astonishment when he had heard nothing. He was much closer, but gets up early (04.50). I don&#39;t know if that might have had a meaning. Him and the resident in 8A have examined the grass fields for marks, but have found nothing. They can of course have landed on the paved road! No one, apart from me, has observed anything close to my good friend in No. 1. He has heard a lot of noise though. The end of it all is that the helicopter only starts the engine again at approx. 03.50 - then I hear the rotors start, it takes off and flies to the NW, and disappears. I can once again clearly see its light in steady rhythm. We are used to being &quot;overflown&quot; every now and then. our location, but not that anyone is landing! I assume that there is a natural explanation, i.a. is there a new helicopter landing pad out on Stevns, probably in connection with the offshore wind turbine project. Have always shown that I would report if I could not find an explanation. You are 100% sure of the time of observation.",

We lay talking about what the day had in store, and I lie looking out of my window, which is opposite my bed. Suddenly I see a &quot;Star&quot; about 3 times larger than Venus (the evening star) coming flying from the west. It doesn&#39;t blink, it doesn&#39;t make any sound. It moves quietly across the night sky, and in between it made some strange zigzag movements. It continued to the east behind the trees so we ran outside to keep looking at the object. It slowly disappeared into the horizon with its strange zigzag movements. But before it disappeared, as we stood outside looking at the object, we saw a light near it. A kind of &quot;star&quot;, which once flashed incredibly strongly and almost lit up the surroundings for less than a second. It all happened very quickly, but one thing we are sure of is that it was at least a rare experience and that it was definitely not an airplane.",

It flies quite slowly across the road without a sound, and with nothing to see but the orange light. The object was quite large, filling both the road and over the treetops. When it had flown away, I restarted the moped and drove forward to watch it as it flew on. But there was nothing to see, it was gone. I know this is an old observation, but it still bothers me a lot.

They are completely red. They do not blink and move at exactly the same pace across the sky. The four front objects form a square. After the front four, there are only a few more objects. But more will follow. In total, I would think that 15 identical, bright red objects pass in a long line with relatively large gaps. They came in approx. from the south-west, and I would think that they were above Bagsværd/Buddinge. They almost described a circle, as if they were flying around Copenhagen. I guess they were a few kilometers up. Out here in Virum/Sorgenfri, we are used to seeing planes on approach to Copenhagen airport. These objects have nothing in common with the usual air traffic, nor was there any indication that they were going to land. Since it is a fairly quiet evening, I am very sure that there was no sound from the objects. I can only imagine that others must have seen the same sight. And there is probably a reasonable explanation for that. But since I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, I&#39;m curious and would like to tell you about it too. Interesting what it was!",

The light seemed larger than an airplane searchlight, but not blinding, and appeared a steady red-yellow/orange without pulsating. Since there was nothing else to compare in the sky (no stars were visible) and I do not know the height of the cloud cover, it is difficult to give an exact size. At first glance, it didn&#39;t seem like there was a solid object behind the light. The weather was cloudy, but visibility was otherwise good.

We were on our way home and took the regular route via Gammel Tinglevvej, which is just outside Ensted Kirke. We walked next to each other and observed the lovely nature in the area. Suddenly something catches our eye in the sky. Two &quot;white&quot; objects float lightly but quickly in the blue sky. I explained to my mother that it looked like the same strange objects that I had seen earlier in the same area on June 26, 2016, which I had also videotaped and shown her. The objects were white, they flew in &quot;flocks&quot;. There was no noise at all! They had no &quot;smoke tail&quot; behind them, as a normal motor plane would have. They were up at jet height, so they couldn&#39;t possibly be gliders. It looked neither like a motor plane nor a glider. It looked like they had short round wings. It also looked like there were windows in them, but this is not certain. We walked further down the road and came across one of my father&#39;s friends who was out mowing grass at the time. The strange flying objects were still in the sky at this time. We asked him if he knew what it was. He looked carefully and could not answer our questions. One of the objects suddenly lit up. It was as clear and bright as a star in the night sky, even though it was bright in the sky. All three of us saw it and couldn&#39;t answer what it was we had just witnessed. The two objects suddenly disappeared. We continued home without being able to catch sight of them again. When we got home and looked out the windows, we could suddenly see them again. It was as if they had been following us. After this experience, we have noticed that our phones, nets and other electrical items have been buzzing/breaking and that our German Shepherd is breaking the windows even though there is nothing. Whether it&#39;s a strange coincidence or not, I don&#39;t know. But we go out one evening at the same time and place with a telescope and a really good camera, and then we hope to be able to capture better pictures and videos of &quot;Them&quot;.",

After a short time it is at the height of a tower with an airplane lamp (which warns airplanes to fly into it). After that, a short time passes before it continues to rise. The object rises very quickly and flies directly to the south, i.e. right for us. As the object is well on its way to the right, it stops and starts flying north, i.e. left from us. While the object is changing direction, it gains a lot of speed and flies away from the scene very quickly, shortly after it flew to the north/left. As it began to gain speed, it flew very quickly into the horizon and disappeared from view. We have talked about the possibility that it could be a Japanese lamp, but when the object picked up speed very quickly and disappeared shortly after into the horizon, we became doubtful. Do you have an explanation for this or is it a UFO? We would very much like an answer, as it interests us a lot.",

I pulled into a parking space on the road and stood looking at the light. I saw several drivers drive by slowly, but they did not stop. I thought it was probably just a flare that someone had shot into the air because it just hung there completely still. But on second thought, it was too big to be an emergency flare. After I watched it for a few minutes, it started to move. First slowly to the right and then move to the first seen position and then slowly to the left. Then I got a little scared and started thinking about getting back into the car, but then it slowly descended into the forest, after which I hurried to get into the car to get home and tell 3 of my friends who were waiting me, but they did not believe my observation at all.",

Approx. 500 meters before Dover Church I observe two oval lights in front of me approx. 45 degrees up in the sky. My first thought was that it must be light reflections from oncoming cars. But there was not immediately any fog or cloud mass on which such a light would be able to reflect. Suddenly they start asynchronously &quot;dancing&quot; with each other or playing some kind of &quot;tick game&quot; with each other. When I&#39;m outside Dover Church, I think for fun that it&#39;s probably some of the dead playing a little. They continue and it seems that they are not that far away from me. I check if it should be reflections on my windshield, but it is not. Measured on my windshield, they are approx. 4 cm. on the long joint and 2 cm. on the short. They are not sharply demarcated, but look like when you make an oblique incidence of light from the side on fog, or on a cloud. It just doesn&#39;t seem like they are quite high up, maybe 100 - 200 meters. They continue to &quot;follow me&quot;, where they occasionally disappear to the side, sometimes separately, sometimes together and quickly reenter in front of me until I reach the first roundabout in Ry. When I get home, I tell my wife about my experience, and it&#39;s no wonder that she looks at me a little &quot;askew&quot;. After a few days we read about the phenomenon in the local newspaper and I decide to write to you. My explanation is that there may be reflections on some invisible water drops that hang low, but where should the &quot;projectors&quot; be ??? My son-in-law, who comes from Wales, says that exactly the same observations have been made several times there. (Swansea, Gower area).",

        "content": "In the middle of August, I stand in the evening and smoke a cigarette out of my window, and suddenly out of my left eye I can see that up in the sky some white balls of light come flying. They were somewhat further down than the stars and had a distinct clear white light. They first flew straight ahead, then made a 90 degree turn and then straight again. It all lasted about 6-9 seconds and there were between 8-12 white balls of light. The following evening I look up at the sky a lot, and to my great surprise I see a small explosion of white light. Again, it is further down than the stars. It is difficult to describe, but the light was coherent and for a millisecond the explosion becomes almost oblong, after which it flattens out into something round and disappears. The size of the explosion was about the size of a hazelnut. I absolutely have expectations that you will investigate it further with my sparse information, I just have to say it. I find it difficult to say the exact day, but I think it happened around 10 - 12 September, but whether it was Monday and Tuesday or Tuesday and Wednesday, I simply don&#39;t remember, and I&#39;m still a bit unsure if, it was the following week.",

        "content": "I was on my way home in my car, north along Frederikssundsvej. When I reached the last roundabout on the way out of Ølstykke, approx. at 22, I saw a small flyer as they usually look, red/green markings, bright white light in the middle, and a strobolight somewhere behind. Nothing unusual there, apart from flying for approx. 200 meters high. It appeared in the north and flew south-southeast. When it was roughly directly off my left side, it abruptly changed direction and flew the exact opposite direction (north-northwest), with no banks and speed changes. When it was over Frederikssundsvej, approx. 100 meters in front of me, 100 meters up, it adjusted to my speed of 85 km/h. There it followed me for 1.6 km. without deviating from his position in relation to my car. During the 1.6 km. blinded it down to the white light in the middle and I could see that it had three closely spaced rectangular floodlights. When &quot;we&quot; got out of the last bit of forest at the 1.6 km from the roundabout, it slowed down abruptly as the center light went out and its marker light/strobe turned orange. Then slid a little to the left and stopped completely, inside a grassy area. In the meantime, I threw the car into the parking lot just before Svestrupvej, hurriedly turned off the engine and got out to have a look. Then it just hung above the ground, for approx. 50 meters high and 150 meters from me. It was completely quiet and there was also no wind/cars. Here I could see that its bottom surface was an equilateral triangle of approx. 5-6 meters per page. The three marker lights, which used to be red/green/strobe, now all glowed constantly orange in each corner of the triangle. It hung completely stationary, as if it had been mounted to a concrete anchor in the ground. After I had looked at it for 20 sec. then it slid south parallel to the road, still no sound, and while accelerating up to the speed of a normal small plane, the orange lights faded to red/green/strobe again and the center light came on. Still very low flying, but increased to approx. 2-300 meters before it turned off, in the direction of Roskilde, approx. down at the roundabout where the observation began. As I followed it the last distance, could see one more, flying a kilometer ahead of it, same direction, height and speed. And to my right, flying from north to south, one more... I just had to sit and recover from the incident before driving home. It was quite overwhelming and strange, but also extremely exciting as I am a technician and interested in flying. This object did not fit anywhere in my otherwise broad knowledge of technology and aircraft. It was a very great experience, and I have taken great care to describe it as precisely and in detail as I could.",

They sit as if on a strip that bends slightly to the right of us. My first thought is that they are lights on a tall crane or a wire or similar. But then think that it is impossible for a crane to stand that high in the harbour. Then we suddenly see that the lights slowly move further up. We stop the car and get out to hear and see better. There is no sound to be heard. One by one, the lights fade higher up and disappear. We start the car and drive on, but then see a single remaining light. We stop the car again and get out and observe that this light also slowly and silently fades further up and disappears. Once home, I look up my FB page to see if anyone has a natural explanation. A few mention possible drones? A friend who lives in the same area says that he has also seen the phenomenon when he was out walking his dog. Is there a good explanation?",

We observed what we believed to be the planet Venus, shining brightly from its position, low above the horizon in a southern direction. After approx. 10 minutes we looked again in the direction of Venus and now saw a strong orange light, which shone with almost the same intensity as Venus - and was in a position approx. 10 degrees to the right of Venus and approx. 5 degrees lower on the horizon. We discussed whether it could be Mars that had come into view, because it gradually got darker and the stars became clearer. After approx. 5 minutes we observed that the orange light became smaller, glowed fainter and disappeared in the same position it was in - as if it flew away from us. After another 10 minutes we looked up at the sky again and now saw 2 orange lights which shone with the same intensity as Venus. They were in a position to the left of Venus and very close to the planet. The 2 lights began to circulate around each other for approx. 10 seconds, after which the No. 2 light split into another 2 lights and where it almost looked like it &quot;lost&quot; one half/light. After this, No. 2 light disappeared, as if it just turned off. No. 1 light slowly faded away as if flying away and getting smaller. The duration of this &quot;light dance&quot; and disappearance lasted approx. 30 seconds. We were very surprised by the sightings, as we have often seen emergency rockets on these edges, which do not resemble at all, and which behave completely differently from this phenomenon. And we are very curious to know if others in the area have also observed the phenomenon.",

I am cycling along Ågade in Frederikssund, in a direction from west to east, when I see that a white-green light appears in the sky. As it becomes sharper, I stop and observe the phenomenon. As it passes me, the center of the light fills approximately, as if you were holding a tennis ball up in front of you in an outstretched arm. The light emitted by the &quot;ball&quot; is very bright and illuminates everything nearby in the split second when it passes me. I can hear a crackling and almost crisp sound as it passes me and can see a condensation-like tail behind the bullet. However, the tail does not remain visible immediately afterwards. Since it flies parallel to the water and horizontally, I can rule out various types of fireworks, emergency rockets, etc. Since I grew up as a neighbor to the American air base in Sdr. Strømfjord, I can also rule out any kind of human-manned vessel, due to lack of beacons, too low a height, and sound. In terms of. its height as it passes me I can&#39;t give an educated guess but will shoot at between 30 and 50 meters (and maybe descending). The reason I can go into detail about the observation is that immediately after the incident I noted all the info.",

It was moving in an easterly direction, but no sound was heard from the object. It must have been later than 9pm as it was almost dark and I was able to observe this light even though I had the light on in the living room.

In the middle of the field hovers something that looks most like a cloud for approx. 8-10m height. The subject is approx. 20-25m above the center and approx. 5m from bottom to top. It mostly looked like 2 deep plates placed on top of each other, but in appearance it resembled a cloud. No sound or light from the object, it just hung there. I wanted us to stop, but she wouldn&#39;t. I think she was a bit scared by this phenomenon, especially because it was neither foggy nor cloudy that summer night at approx. 00.30. So to her it struck me as a bit of a hoot that anyone could believe such nonsense, but she still wouldn&#39;t hold back and study this further.",

Fortunately, I had the position of the 2 stars in relation to each other, and was thus able to register the movement. The whole experience lasted maybe 30 seconds. Subsequently, I became aware that the incident took place below and slightly to the left of the Chariot. Possibly the right of the 2 stars was the lower left star of the Chariot (subject to caveats). A moment later, while I was pondering over the episode, a very powerful shooting star came from the ENE towards the WSW covering half the firmament. Hope the above experience is of interest, I myself am very surprised by what I observed.",

We had both initially thought it was a shooting star, but had ruled it out as it was simply too visible for too long and too big. We had also each thought about whether it was a New Year&#39;s rocket or a plane. We also excluded this as we did not think this was consistent with our observations.

One has a good knowledge of aircraft and new technology, but neither of us comes up with an educated guess as to what it could be that we had seen.

I, the undersigned, have seen a lot in the sky, throughout my life, both meteorites and various other funny things, but never anything like this?? My partner and I have absolutely the same idea of what we have seen, even if neither of us can explain what it was!!!",

        "content": "My girlfriend and I are walking down Søndersø in Viborg after we have visited a friend in town. We walk on a path along the lake, and we talk and have fun. I look up and quite by chance spot a plane (I think). Because at first it really looks like a plane. A glowing thing of some kind, but not flashing, just glowing white and flying across the sky. At first I just think it&#39;s a plane, but when I look closer, it doesn&#39;t look like a plane at all, but a round circle of some kind. I notice it&#39;s not a plane because I think it&#39;s changing speed. I notice that it&#39;s round, but it&#39;s notched all the way around like several sort of triangles sticking out, but it&#39;s still round. It was only tiny thanks, so it&#39;s a little hard to explain. To put it as I perceived it; it is round with triangles all around. It&#39;s flying as I said, and when it dawns on me that it&#39;s not a plane because it&#39;s not flashing, but just constantly glowing white and flying across the sky, I think my next thought; That it&#39;s a shooting star. But a shooting star does not fly so slowly. It almost changes speed, a little up in speed and a little down again, but nothing that remarkable. My boyfriend thinks it&#39;s a bird, but it&#39;s completely dark and there&#39;s no light in the sky. The next thing the object does is slow down and speed up again (can&#39;t quite remember). What I definitely remember is that it speeds up (I think). What I can definitely remember is that suddenly it says ping, and then it&#39;s gone. It simply disappeared. If it is finally a bird, it can&#39;t just suddenly disappear and there was no light in the sky. It gives me such chills. It was very fascinating, but after I watched it, I just want to go home. When we turn around the path in a bend to come up towards Randersvej, which goes through both Søndersø and Nørresø, I look out over the lake again and see an object exactly like it. This time it changes trajectory so that it either flies straight ahead or to the side. But it flies in very FAST and STRAIGHT lines. It does not turn, but change trajectory like this; quickly across the sky, then it flies quickly to the side, but still in a soft way. When it has flown a bit, then all of a sudden; ping, it&#39;s gone. There were no clouds and it was very clear. The strangest thing about it all was that it seemed like it was way up in the sky. Closest up to the stars, but still it seemed like it was right above us... So far down. The first one didn&#39;t fly over the water, but the second one did. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t a bird, as a bird hovers and turns in a different way (as a bird does). This one turned like this; ping to the right, ping to the left, etc. And a bird cannot light up the sky, and if it finally does, the light on it cannot suddenly go out in the same place as it shone a little earlier. It looked very mysterious and I am very objective in my description. Hope that doesn&#39;t sound corny. I have never experienced anything like this before and would like an explanation. I&#39;ve seen satellites before, but this wasn&#39;t a satellite. The first object flew from west to east and then disappeared on its way to the east. The other flew from south to north and then flew in all possible direct lines.",

Suddenly a red light appears, and I tell my girlfriend on the phone that now someone has fired an emergency rocket. I take it for an emergency flare because of its bright red light. A moment later, however, the light changes color to bright white - and now begins to switch between the two colors at irregular intervals. I tell my girlfriend that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an emergency rocket, but something else, and I observe for the next few minutes the movements of the UFO. The dot of light - because I didn&#39;t see it like anything else, it was too far away and it was almost twilight - moves a little around, back and forth, but mostly to the right. Suddenly it turns off - only to turn on again less than 20 seconds later, a little further to the left than it disappeared. The height was pretty much constant, but the movement in the horizontal plane seemed very random. Finally, the light went out, almost like an old-fashioned TV being turned off - it got smaller and smaller, and disappeared. I tried to contact SUFUI on the phone but there was no answer. (I thought it was a hotline...? But I guess there isn&#39;t as much status in UFO hunting as there was when I was a boy... I was an avid UFO hunter myself...) Immediately I would think that what I saw could be a plasma phenomenon of some kind. As I said, the movement in the horizontal plane seemed too random to be a vessel controlled by a thinking being. I am a big fan of Eugen Semitjov&#39;s book &quot;Unfathomable UFOs&quot;, and I agree with his thoughts regarding plasma phenomena.",

The thing that caught me the most, besides the fact that they looked like they were on fire, was how fast they were going and that they were flying right over and past the top of our building. They followed each other very closely and precisely with maybe a meter distance between them. And then it went as fast as the sound of a quick hiss, but there was no sound at all. It looked really beautiful, just had the feeling of having been lucky to see something so special, which unfortunately I haven&#39;t seen since.",

First an orange glowing dot came flying and it turned sharply to the southwest just above the neighbor&#39;s roof and outside my windows, then another came and I could then see a row of 5 in total coming at the same height one after the other with approx. 2-3 minutes apart, everyone turned sharply to the southwest, and from my point it looked like it was beyond Djursland. I could follow them until they were little dots. They seemed to be holding both altitude and course. I told others about what I had seen, but I didn&#39;t know where to go with it. But then it happens that I am invited to my neighbor&#39;s house, who lives on the 3rd floor of the same building with almost the same view, this New Year&#39;s Eve 2009. We then stand in her window and look at all the fireworks, and it gradually dies down approx. . 20 min past 12, and then I say for fun, so now the UFOs may well come, and they did, but this time there were only 2, same light-color size and at the same height, but unfortunately her window turns a little more slanted to mine so I couldn&#39;t see where they went. But this time I got a picture of the last of them, and also my neighbor as a witness, I can&#39;t see where to put the picture here, but can send it if I get an address.",

Then I just look up at the sky just for fun, when I immediately spot a strange strong white light coming towards the ground at insanely high speed. It&#39;s getting bigger, and I thought maybe it could be a shooting star very high up. Approx. 4-5 kilometers up, but no it flew in a zigzag and then up and down side to side. Very strange. Never seen anything like it, which then disappeared in a flash. Couldn&#39;t understand at all what it was I saw. I&#39;m sure it was a UFO, because it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve experienced it. but 3 times in my life. Similarly, it is very difficult to explain it in writing.",

        "content": "Sunday 26 July 2015 around 22.55 I see something strange. I am standing in my kitchen on the second floor - the light is off - the window is open - and I can hear the usual traffic noise from Hovedvejen/Roskildevej. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I see a strange light coming from the south – down around Brøndby Stadium – in a northerly direction. It looks somewhat like &quot;gaslight&quot; in that it flickers between blue and green. It moves horizontally across the sky – it neither loses nor gains altitude – and then it is completely silent. As it passes my window I can see it has an oval shape. You have to make an effort to spot it, it is surrounded by some white dots. It is probably 50-100 meters above the ridge of the neighboring property - which is also a 2-storey dwelling. It seems to follow a route up along Vestvolden/Motorring 3. After passing my window, but before it seems to reach Jyllingevej, the light disappears abruptly - and it becomes invisible. The episode lasts 5-10 seconds. Then I look out of the window to the south and immediately spot a plane taking off from Kastrup and heading south. The wing lights of an airliner are clearly visible over a distance of more than 15 km. The &quot;gas light&quot; I had just witnessed was subdued - it did not sting the eyes in any way. Could the white spots I saw encircling the oval object be some kind of heat shield? It is difficult to say anything about the size – it could be anything from 6-12 meters long and 2-3 meters high.",

It was no flyer, no red or green lights, and when it had passed us there was no white tail light. There was no engine noise and the fireball was completely silent. When the balls of light had passed us, it turned as if in a northerly direction and disappeared on the horizon approx. 30 degrees above us.

        "content": "For approx. 30 years ago I had a strange experience. I was then a child of 8-10 years, I think. It was the end of summer, when the harvest had been done and towards evening. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t remember many details after so many years, but I will try to tell what I remember. At the time, I lived outside Tommerup. Precisely Tommerupvej 224, where I grew up. One evening, when I had been out playing, I had walked down our gravel road towards our neighbor who was approx. 100 m to the southwest, - I think. I don&#39;t quite remember how it all came together, but I think I was downstairs looking for my older sister, and as I reach a little way down towards the neighboring house, she comes running up the road. She seems scared and frightened. I don&#39;t remember what she says or if I see anything at this point, but I myself run back to our garage, which is under the house. On the left side of the garage, a staircase leads up to the house itself. Walking up the stairs, I turn to see what was really wrong and why we ran up to our house, or at least that&#39;s what I remember now. Down in front of the garage of our neighboring house approx. 3 m out in the cornfield (which has been harvested at this time) I see a metallic gray object that looks very much like what you would call a classic UFO today. Around the vessel are some beings. I don&#39;t remember how many, but think 2-4. The creatures, as far as I can tell, are not particularly large and grey. I run around the corner of the house, but look forward again. Here, however, I feel that one creature becomes aware of me, and I get scared and run into the house to my parents and tell them that there is something strange down in the field in front of the neighbor&#39;s garage. They look out of the window, but can&#39;t see the big picture, as there are plants and it&#39;s getting dark. The next day I ask the neighbor&#39;s boy if he has seen anything strange as we go down to the road to catch our school taxi. He says that he and his family sat and watched it from their living room window, which was approx. 15 m from where the object had landed. They had been told by their parents that these were devils and they were not allowed to look. It should be added that the family were Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. When I came home from school, I noticed a large round spot in the field that had been burned where the object had been. It was approx. 3-4 meters in diameter, I think. I remember this ring was there long after the incident. As I said, it was many years ago and I don&#39;t remember the details. Strangely enough, I have been interested in UFOs for many years and read many books about UFOs, but only recently it seems that this incident has come to the surface again. I mentioned it to my sister, who could confirm that she had experienced the incident as well, but didn&#39;t really believe it herself and therefore dismissed it. I don&#39;t know how much you can use that somewhat imprecise and old observation, but I just recently felt the urge to come forward with it, so that&#39;s it. I know that to many it probably sounds like pure fantasy, but there really is so much that goes on until you find out what it is or recognize what it is. Many people have a strange belief that we are the only intelligent beings in the universe, which I personally find completely utopian. When you have experienced such an incident yourself, it only confirms that we are absolutely not alone in the universe and probably not very intelligent either, compared to the beings who are able to travel here. Many times things simply require that you open your horizons to see what is right at our feet, but often unfortunately we have to see it with our own eyes, and even then it can be difficult to believe what you see, and sometimes even harder to deal with.",

It also came slower so I thought it might be a helicopter. But the weather was calm - no obvious reason for a rescue operation. Then I listened - no - absolutely no - sound. Then I turned around running back and in (with a slow dog in tow as it definitely didn&#39;t think we had walked enough) called to my husband to come out and have a look. We ran to the neat door, and it flew just as quietly over the sitka firs. My husband is visually impaired, but with normal night vision. I told him to run in and get the binoculars. It took some time (since I had thrown it somewhere it shouldn&#39;t be), but when he brought it (a Cobra - Optisan 8x24 field 6.0) that flying thing was still hanging there between the treetops (without my wanting to set an angle on it). I could now clearly see three white lights in a line. In addition, there was a red light that seemed to swing around.",

It was in an easterly direction, and slowly disappeared in a south-easterly direction. There were no sounds to be heard, but the object also seemed like it was very far away (like out in space). Have previously (in the early 90s) observed a comet, but it moved relatively quickly, so if it was a comet, it must have been very close to the earth. The observation lasted approx. 2-3 minutes. Went in for camera, but the object was almost gone when I came back out, so unfortunately didn&#39;t get any pictures. Has anyone else seen the same thing?",

These three objects were to the left of the sunset. When we stopped at the side of the road, we saw two more objects of the same kind (though less conspicuous) to the right of the sunset. You could not sense that the objects were moving, but after 10 minutes you could clearly see that they were moving away from the original formation. We drove on after 10 minutes and didn&#39;t get to see the objects disappear, but it&#39;s certainly possible that they were there for a considerable amount of time before we spotted them as well as after we drove. The images I have attached are of relatively good quality and show a reddish blur of small black bodies -- this could at first glance look like some kind of rocket like those used to launch satellites. I saw to my surprise that an observation from Skovlunde, at roughly the same time, describes the same thing.",

        "content": "The two luminous dots moved parallel in a south-southwest direction without changing their mutual distance. The imaginary line between them was approx. 45 degrees in relation to their common direction of movement. I observed the two luminous dots as elongated and smudged, while my daughter claims they were pure dots. Their color was almost like the color of the high-pressure sodium lamps used for street lighting. My first thought was that it was a question of the light reflections that one can observe in damp weather from car lights when their light is reflected in electrical overhead lines. However, it was not humid weather, there were no cars, the color was wrong and the height of the sky was too high to be reflections in overhead lines. My next thought was that it could be birds illuminated from below, for example from the stadium lighting from Dalum Stadion, which (as far as I know) is located in the direction of observation. However, this would mean that the birds would have to move at considerable speeds, estimated at several thousand km/h. In my opinion, it cannot have been a question of planes, as they should have been audible with the given trajectory and speed. I have some experience with satellite observations. It was also not about satellites, as both the speed and the size of the light phenomenon were wrong. What, in my opinion, would fit best in terms of trajectory and speed would be a meteor, but in that case it would have to have been blown into two pieces. I myself have never observed anything other than short-lived shooting stars, and thus not a large meteor that crosses the entire sky. Even so, I don&#39;t think that the yellowish color matches my expectation for the color of such a thing.",

It wasn&#39;t a real Frisbee, but a plastic plate. We ended up throwing it into the merchant&#39;s yard and therefore stopped the game as we couldn&#39;t get into the yard and pick it up. It was quiet and starry. We stood out on the road (in the middle of the road) and talked. My sister and I stood next to each other facing the neighbor boy. There were approx. 1 - 1.5 meters between us. My sister and I stood with our backs to the west and the neighbor boy&#39;s back turned to the east. After we had been standing there for a few minutes, it came. It was disc-shaped and was approx. 20 cm in diameter. The shape was like 2 plates that are joined so that the bottom points upwards on one and downwards on the other. It had no cow eyes or flashing lights. The most peculiar thing about its appearance was that it resembled a hologram: it looked as if it consisted only of light (green) and not solid matter - though not one like a glint of light, the shape of which cannot be seen, as when looking directly on a strong light source. On the contrary, it had a clearly defined form. I could see right through it but couldn&#39;t see into it (sic!). It came from a northerly direction at a height that was just below my eye level at the time. I saw it when it was a few meters from us. It flew straight towards us at a pace similar to slow walking. Its movement was smooth and it didn&#39;t zig-zag or jump or anything like that. It continued and flew right between us. I (and the other two) were less than a meter from it and could have touched it if I dared. It continued between us and on in the same direction, pace and height. It flew approx. 5 meters further, after which it rose upwards approx. 45 degrees, accelerated and disappeared in 1-2 seconds. It didn&#39;t fly into a cloud when it was cloudless, nor did it go behind anything else. When it had disappeared, the neighbor boy asked if we had seen it too. We nodded and ran to my mother and told her. I knew even then that you could forget important things, so I carefully reviewed the experience to make sure I could remember the details. I never spoke to the boy next door about it again, and I lost contact with him when we moved shortly after. My sister only remembers seeing something strange but can&#39;t remember any details.",

        "content": "We were driving towards Copenhagen when I noticed some bright light in the sky. It occurred to us that it was probably a plane waiting for landing permission, but we became curious when it stood completely still in the air, and it was as if it was coming closer to us. It was clear to see 4 white lights, and two blue lights and a red light that went from one white light to the other. Three - four different red lights. We concluded that it must be helicopters, but the light was coming from underneath, and was going straight from side to side and not moving around, as if there had been a red light on a helicopter. Suddenly it began to move very strongly and flew off to the right, where we discovered another strange phenomenon. They flew very fast beside us, but were far away. At one point we could see that it looked square, almost like a rhombus. Suddenly one sped up and flew away from us, and just disappeared... Then we discovered that there was one more and it was quite close. We could almost see a cone of light from it, and it was completely still. All three were exactly the same with the blue, white and red lights. Diamond-shaped and quite large, although they were probably far from us. We couldn&#39;t hear any sound even if we rolled down the window and slowed down. But we were also on the highway. They took turns standing still in the sky and speeding up a lot. They were in the sky quite early on the motorway, and the last two only disappeared around Copenhagen, where the road started to be lit. I don&#39;t believe in UFOs, but this is very mysterious. We hope that there are others who have seen it too, and that we can get a logical explanation for the phenomenon. I can&#39;t answer which direction they had, but they flew on our right side from Næstved towards Kbh. The one that disappeared flew away in the same direction.",

Since I couldn&#39;t judge the distance, I also couldn&#39;t judge the size exactly, but it must have been between 40 cm and 150 cm in diameter. It could also be described as similar to a rice lamp. It was less than 150 meters away, because I could see the trees 150 m in the background, and more than 40 meters (came into view behind some houses) The bullet flew for approx. 10-20 meters high (the terrain varies a lot in this area). It was completely silent. When it was almost out of my line of sight, it seemed to rapidly accelerate upwards until I could no longer see it. I have very good eyesight and am absolutely certain that it was not some kind of known flying object. I was not under the influence of drugs.",

At the same time, it is getting bigger (because it was closer to us?) and more and more orange-red in colour. Finally it disappeared out of sight, just above the horizon to the north. After a number of seconds I started filming it and I have an approx. 3 min long video of the phenomenon/UFO.

One afternoon we wanted a trip to &quot;town&quot; and do some shopping. On the way there we spotted something up in the sky. It was summer, high sun and clear weather. It looked like 2 plates put together. It was grayish- actually colorless. We were a group that all saw the same thing. It zig-zagged away from us. After looking at it for a bit, we ran home as fast as we could to get a camera, but unfortunately we didn&#39;t get to photograph it. It was a great experience, I will never forget it, but there are not many people who believe in me apart from my son. Now I would like to know if anyone else has experienced the same thing?",

Usually look up at the stars when I&#39;m not staring down at my smartphone. A few weeks back I noticed a change in the constellation when I look up. I see something that looks like a star at first glance, but it blinks, so my mind is drawn to an airplane, but it is standing still in the air. In addition, it changes size, if you look closely, you can see that it shrinks and then becomes large again, and it repeats this in an almost &quot;hysterical&quot; way. It can easily find a way to move, but only seen it do so slowly. It hasn&#39;t been there every night and only see it when it&#39;s starry, but it&#39;s there NOW as I write here, and it&#39;s the 4th time in 2 weeks. Usually the same place in the sky, southeast direction, where it appears like over the neighbor&#39;s farm! It is difficult to tell the height, but it is clearly lower than the stars. I usually look at it for 2-10 minutes before I go back into the heat. Have shown it to my wife and a few family members and we are all amazed. Have also filmed it several times with my iPhone X, so have video of it even though the camera struggles with auto focus and the darkness. What and who should be contacted to get an answer? I thought it was very fascinating, and it could be wildly exciting to observe the phenomenon through some proper optics, so if you have something like that at your disposal and you want to, you are welcome here at the address. I can only say when it&#39;s there, it doesn&#39;t seem like it&#39;s going away any time soon and would like to know what/who it/they are.",

        "content": "We were out for an evening walk at approx. 10 p.m. It was dark when we started walking, but could see grey/bluish clouds in the night sky and a few stars. At the beginning of the walk, Cissel sees a shooting star, and soon after we both saw a lightning/strong flash of light by a single whitish cloud in the sky. We both noticed that it was not like ordinary lightning as it was very broad, short in length and was not followed by a thunderclap. The phenomenon occurred in the northeast. We continued our walk for 10 min. more before we returned home as it started to rain. We chose to seek shelter from the rain under a tree overlooking a field (northwest) with a small patch of nearby trees about 100 meters from where we stand (approx. 10 meter tall trees.) In the distance a larger forest max. one km away. Cissel then sees a whitish round light that does not look like a star, the light aligns with the tops of the nearby trees. We reckon that the light was closest to the distant forest, or further away. At first we both think it&#39;s an airplane. But then we observe that no flashing lights occur. The light first moves straight up, then slightly to the left, and we both start to joke a bit that it doesn&#39;t quite know which direction it wants to move in. I jokingly exclaim that it&#39;s a UFO. It continues to move in alternating directions at short intervals. Right, left, slightly down and up. When it is at its highest point, which is about 30-35 degrees from our point of view and is still moving slowly upwards, it disappears like turning off a switch and does not return, even if we stand and look for a while time. There were no clouds in the sky where the light was and nothing to cover its light. On our walk home we saw several airplanes flying to the east, and the light in no way resembled these airplanes, nor stars, which were now more visible in the sky. When we went out to the observation site in daylight, we saw that there was a house by the nearby trees, and there were electricity pylons with wires connected between them, which sloped over the field. The electrical wires were in the field of vision where we spotted the light phenomenon. We reacted quite calmly and jokingly at first, but after 10-20 sec. we both got the feeling that this was not quite normal. When the light disappeared with one, we were both very surprised. The light was slightly larger than a star, round and whitish, yellow/orange and with a faint red glow. The colors blended more into each other than being defined.",

By writing this, I hope to get some sort of clarification on whether others may have experienced something similar. One evening I was on my way home from work (on foot because my bike was flat). I saw in the sky three very bright stars that I did not remember seeing before, in exactly this pattern, like an isosceles triangle. I&#39;m no star expert though, so I didn&#39;t think much more of it. However, it puzzled me (and really unsettled me) that an equally bright star moved from the lower right star to the lower left star, up to the upper star, and then started over; down to the lower right star, etc. This went on for several minutes as I tried to figure out what could possibly be moving that fast. Since these lights looked exactly like bright stars, they must (in my mind) be moving at thousands of kilometers per hour to get around so fast and make such sharp &quot;turns&quot;. Finally, the star moved quickly away in an uneven path and with a speed that varied greatly and suddenly, before disappearing completely.",

I watched them during my drive for approx. a quarter of an hour, after which they disappeared to the east at high speed.

A circular light appeared in the night sky, like an airplane/helicopter. Right after this there was again a circular light as if there was a new helicopter/plane close behind this and another one behind this spot. Then there were 3 spots of light, powerful as airplane lights. Then they disappeared with one and changed direction and went down (still 3 spots) then they changed direction and went up and then they disappeared with one. It didn&#39;t look like a laser show. The phenomenon was easy to see, as there is a good dark night sky outside Esbjerg when there are no clouds.",

        "content": "I must regret that I did not note down the day and exact time, but the sighting took place 2-3 weeks ago and has puzzled me ever since. It was afternoon and sunny weather and I had laid down on my back on our buried sea trampoline to dry off after a dip in our garden basin/pool, so I was lying looking straight up into the blue sky. It was a clear day with a few clouds on the horizon, but the area I looked up into was completely cloudless and there was only a very light wind (at least at the ground where I was). A flock of birds had just flown by (they were not flying in formation) and shortly after they had passed I spotted a circular object in shades of gray flying high in the sky at a very high speed in the south-east or east-south -Eastern direction (by the way, in almost the same direction as the birds had flown shortly before, although they were at a much lower altitude). The object&#39;s flight path went almost directly over where I was lying, although a little further to the northeast as it was closest, so not quite 90 degrees above the horizon where I was lying, but close. So I saw the object almost directly from below, and from that angle it looked like a perfectly round &quot;plate&quot;. The colors were in shades of grey, and even though it was a perfectly clear day I would describe it as a bit hazy or surrounded by a faint haze, so it was dull and not reflective. It can be difficult to judge altitude and speed from the ground, but I would compare altitude and speed across the sky to that of a high-speed airliner, if not a bit faster. The direction of flight was constant except for two sudden, small, sideways &quot;jerks&quot;, so the movement pattern definitely deviated from that of an airplane. The only natural explanation I can come up with would have to be a gray weather balloon which was in a particularly windy and slightly turbulent air layer high up. The reason I&#39;m reporting here, however, is that I don&#39;t really think it looked like a weather balloon, and I&#39;m particularly having trouble getting the speed it flew at to be consistent with a balloon. I had it in sight for 20-30 seconds max, so shorter than I could have reached to get a camera before it was gone in an east-south-east direction. For the record, I had not consumed alcohol (which, by the way, I only do rarely and in extremely controlled quantities), and I had neither sunstroke nor the sun in my eyes.",

        "content": "That night, my then-girlfriend Louise and I went up to the city to buy cigarettes. We hadn&#39;t gone more than 200 meters when we spotted the object in the sky. I can&#39;t remember which one of us saw it first but we couldn&#39;t hear any kind of mechanical sound, like an airplane, helicopter ect. There were 3 very orange lights in the sky, like the rattle of an orange. My first impression was that it was some new Chinese &quot;firework&quot; that consists of a form of cardboard/paper that is about 40 cm in width and length and a meter in height. You light a light inside and it can float up to 100 meters into the air. I had seen such &quot;fireworks&quot; New Year 2009/10. But after just a few seconds, I could see that the speed of the object, the synchronization between the lights and the lightest constant sharpness (stability) made it impossible to be what I first thought, as the fireworks light is easily affected by wind and floats much slower. The object flew on over one of the residential buildings on kastanievej towards Sdr. Boulevard in a N/NW direction. We were going the same way and had barely 150-200 meters up to Sdr.Boulevard, so we went up there at a very fast pace to be able to follow the UFO, and we lost sight of it for 10-15 seconds when it flew over the residential building on Chestnut road. When we got up to Sdr. Boulevard we are facing Ansgar facility (a park), and I had expected a good view to be able to observe the vessel some more, but it was gone. As it was autumn and the leaves on the trees had started to fall, I was a bit surprised that it was now out of sight and remained so for the rest of our trip. The time, place and direction of the vessel is very correct as Louise sent a message to a mutual friend immediately after we had seen the object. That text message is dated 10 Oct. 2010 at 03:38, and I have lived here for 12 years so know the place and directions to the 4 corners of the world as well as you know the value of 100 kroner.",

We began to slow down and focus only on the objects that were completely inexplicable. Other cars almost stopped completely, and one pulled over to the side of the road on Ballerup Byvej. On the road, there are 2 gas stations next to each other, and we chose to drive into one to stop. I mean we pulled up to a Shell tank and there were 3 other cars where the passengers got out and pointed to the sky. A taxi driver stood outside with a mobile phone and called. The 8 huge blue balls of light stood completely still in the air. It felt like they were looking at us and at the same time were completely silent. My children and I were completely stunned and could not say anything. My youngest son, who was 6 years old at the time, was hanging out of the window and pointing up. All I said was for him to stay in the car. My whole body was shaking, it was the most scarry thing I have ever experienced. We were very close to the bullets at that time. The 8 balls of light were distributed in such a way that 4 of them went from the ground and slanted upwards, while the other 4 went on slanting vertically upwards towards the sky very high up. I think we stood and watched for a few minutes when suddenly all 8 of them started driving into each other at a very high speed. So fast that you couldn&#39;t follow them. And then one by one they disappeared like ping.. ping without any noise at all. All 3 of us were totally out of it, it was very surreal and unfortunately in our wonder and anxiety about it we didn&#39;t really get to talk to some of the other witnesses. However, the taxi driver said what it was and I answered a UFO. But it was as if no one dared to admit, they were convinced that it was a UFO... or rather 8 UFOs in the same place. What we saw was both very beautiful, but also shocking. The experience is still with us, and sometimes we still talk about the inexplicable balls of light. Tried telling others about the incident but like people make fun of it. So have tried to repress it, but now I finally get to tell and write it.. and it&#39;s a bit of a relief. Hope you can use it for something :-)",

I spot a plane - I think at first, because it flashes red - but when I had been looking at it for approx. 5 minutes the object had not moved. I now go in and get binoculars (a regular bird binocular) and see that there are 2 more objects flashing in the same way in red, green and yellow colors in the southwest/western sky. When I went out here at At 0.30 the objects were still in the sky and they are still there. They don&#39;t seem to have moved but are still flashing very clearly in multiple colors. Can someone explain what this could be. Is it the moon&#39;s (almost full moon) rays that give the colors or what could it be.",

At the moment it is starry in the evening and I enjoy looking at the stars and moon to the west. Has a wide view over open areas and lots of sky to the southwest, west and north to the Helsingør motorway. Yesterday I saw something that I first thought was a small and large star. The little one was approx. at 11 compared to the big one. They stood still at first, but then they moved - I think - within a short time - maybe less than 1/2 hour right down to the horizon to the west, and disappeared. I was a bit puzzled - it didn&#39;t look like an airplane and there were no flashing/red lights. When I went home from work in Herlev today, I heard a small group of people talking about the lights, they were locals who had observed the same lights, but couldn&#39;t see them for so long as they lived down in the city. But obviously there has been something. In these times, one could of course think that these are military exercises from the Danish defence. But don&#39;t all planes including helicopters usually have flashing lights/red lights? These 2 luminous round things looked like a big and a small star....but the earth doesn&#39;t spin that fast...or what? Has anyone else seen anything? Will be happy for a feedback. 😊",

Then number 2 approx. 60 degrees above the horizon from the south with a golden color and significantly larger and stronger light than the clearest planets. Number 3 is a small dot (normal satellite size) which appears to continue obliquely from number 2. At the same time, numbers 4 and 5 appear, equally bright as number 2, in the same orbit from the south, perhaps 30 and 40 degrees above the horizon . My wife and I watch the big 3 at the same time until the first one disappears approx. 90 degrees up, while the last 2 disappear a little later at a height of 70-80 degrees above the southern horizon. Both the orbit and speed make it most likely that this was a larger satellite that had been torn into several pieces at an earlier time during the first encounter with the atmosphere, and then burned up slowly while maintaining the original orbit.",

        "content": "At approx. 16.30 on 23/04/2009 my son calls. He is standing out in his garden looking at a strange phenomenon through his binoculars. I quickly grab my own binoculars and rush outside. With a cell phone in one hand and binoculars in the other, I get instructions from my son on where to find the phenomenon. I can&#39;t see it with the naked eye and search with binoculars. The sky is blue and almost cloudless. After a few misunderstandings about east and west, I get a milky white object in the binoculars. Approx. at 8 and at 5 at a short distance from the milky white object, there are two slightly smaller objects with a metallic shine. The small objects do not stand still, but seem &quot;nervous&quot;. The small object, standing approx. at 8, makes a sudden movement towards the large object and back again. Almost like a jump. Back and forth in less than a second. A few seconds later, the two small objects disappear so quickly that I have no precise sense of direction. Maybe to the northwest. The large object remains standing. It is high in the sky to the north, about 70-80 degrees up. The sun is low to the left (west, southwest), and it fits with the object being illuminated by the sun. After observing the object for approx. 5 minutes without any movement or activity, we call it off, as it is a bit difficult with only one hand to hold the binoculars for that long. We agree that we will be called later. After a few more minutes, the object begins to move slowly to the south, i.e. even higher in the sky. I lay down on the lawn with the binoculars to keep it more stable. The movement is slow, and after a short pause it begins to move slightly to the south-southwest (toward the sun). Then the object turns sharply to the northwest (a turn of approx. 110-120 degrees). The speed is still slow, but it does not turn in an arc, but in a &quot;break&quot; without changing the speed. Suddenly the object is gone. I don&#39;t see the direction, it&#39;s just gone. After searching the area of the sky where it disappeared for approx. 5 min., I give up finding it again. Our son calls again. He has also lost sight of the object. If I were to judge the size of the object, I would compare it to when I see an airliner flying across the sky at a high altitude. I had approx. the same tremors in the binoculars due to the distance, so the sensation was that the object was the size of an airliner. I will also say that the object was quite clear in binoculars and there were no fins or anything protruding from the object. It was completely smooth. Once I knew exactly where it was in the sky, I could also see it with the naked eye. I sensed at first that it was a spherical object, but as I observed the object, it initially changed shape slightly. as if it occasionally became more elliptical in shape. I therefore began to sense that I was seeing a domed underside of an object that was not spherical. The observation took place in Horsens South and for me lasted approx. 15 minutes It gave an unusually strange sensation to see such an object in daylight. I am used to seeing many strange light phenomena at night, as I have two reflecting telescopes, one large and one small portable. I have also often seen many different planes at different heights and distances with my binoculars. It sure wasn&#39;t a plane, a balloon, a helicopter, or anything else I&#39;ve seen before. The two small objects I caught a glimpse of were also highly unusual. Especially their very sudden movements and completely different way of shining. As if they themselves shone or were completely shiny and made of metal, whereas the large object was milky white and illuminated by the sun.",

        "content": "I clearly remember playing in the living room on Glentevej in Odense. I looked out the open French balcony door on the first floor, beyond Odense N and Rising school. Up there I saw an elongated brownish/grayish/silvery cigar-shaped thing slowly sliding across the sky. As so often in those years, at first I thought it was the usual airship. The distance to the object was very far away and I could not directly identify it as an airship. I followed it for a few minutes and also saw a jet or other aircraft pulling contrails in the same direction, and this aircraft was significantly faster than the &quot;cigar&quot;. But it was only when something strange happened that I thought it must be something else, namely what I then called a rocket. The object simply changed direction and suddenly stood upright before shooting upwards. This is when I called my mother, I was only 6 or 5 years old at the time, and showed her what it was and explained the matter to her. A relatively short time after the object began an ascent, it disappeared and we could not see it thereafter. As I recall, the object left a trail of smoke, which was the immediate reason I saw this as a rocket. I have subsequently, as I have grown older, searched for others who have seen the object, and believe I have found a similar description from the same area, however I cannot remember exactly where I found this, but believe it was on the internet for a some years ago. I very much doubt that this was not a UFO in and of itself, I was far too young at the time to have seen and heard about the phenomenon, and there has been no other explanation for the sighting until now. I had been watching television at the time and had followed the moon landing and the Apollo program on television. I&#39;m not entirely sure of the year and direction, but I know exactly where and in which direction I looked, so I can find the exact data via map if it&#39;s interesting. A little old, but still an interesting and still, for me, inexplicable incident.",

Looking up and saying look honey, where my girlfriend at the same moment exclaims, what the hell is that?! We see a missile like object coming from the north direction, flying in a south direction at a speed we have never experienced before. There is no sound at all. We just see this missile, with a tail of fire behind it, which in the sky is about 7-8 cm. long with fire behind him. We both say what the hell was that? We talked for a bit and agreed that it might be a fireball or something. We have both seen shooting stars and this cannot be compared at all. If others have seen the same object, we would very much like to know. We saw it over Sakskøbing and think it could have been seen elsewhere too, as the weather is clear and starry. It came from almost due north and flew almost due south. The object had a trail of fire behind it and no sound. It was very high up in the sky, but approx. 7-8 cm. long, including the tail of fire.",

        "content": "I had to go out to feed my horses, so I just took the dog with me so he could pee. The horses are in our stable here at home. When I go around there it is dark, so therefore I know that there was nothing when I entered the barn. I leave the door open while I arrange their feed, 10 buckets to be mixed and the scale teases. I go straight in to exchange weights and when I come back I see out of the corner of my eye that there is some light over the neighbor&#39;s road right by our horse paddock. My first thought was that it was probably the neighbor who was sitting and talking on the phone in the car, he thought he had come while I was inside to change the scales. While I arrange fodder and the horses are fed, I look out in between and think that it is strange that he is standing there and the car is switched off. I look a little further and see that it is not his car as the outline is much larger, so my next thought is that it must be the tractor. Can hear my dog running around and beeping. I call her as I think she has seen the neighbor and she is not going to run over there. She comes into the barn and is all crazy and I send her out again when I&#39;m done. Then looks again and can see that one light is somewhat larger than the other, and it is the red one, and can see that it is not a tractor, but something larger. I turn off the light as I&#39;m a bit curious about what the neighbor is doing and think I can see it better with the light off. When I go out, I see my dog sitting completely frozen, and he is looking over there. She usually barks and runs around, so weird behavior. I look over there again and now it&#39;s up in the air. I get to thinking what the hell is that, there is no sound at all. I rummage through all my pockets for my phone as I want to film it. Unfortunately discovers that I have put on my boyfriend&#39;s jacket, so no phone. I get a little scared as I can&#39;t see or describe what it is I see and it doesn&#39;t make any sense in my head. It flies away quietly and I can only see the red light. It rises quietly and flies diagonally over towards the motorway in a southerly direction.",

Distance to the flying object is estimated to be around 100 metres. The size of the objects is estimated to be around the size of an ordinary &quot;party balloon&quot;. The second witness estimated the size to be different from a balloon. Although balloons have been written about, the objects do not seem to have their precise character. This is judged from the fact that they were floating in a perfectly right-angled formation. In addition, the formation moved with a significantly higher speed and directional focus than ordinary balloons. The distance between the objects is estimated to be between 10 and 20 meters, and of course there was nothing visible that &quot;connected&quot; or fixed the objects to each other. In addition, the formation seemed to rotate slightly throughout the observation. However, as mentioned before, the distance between the objects seems to remain constant, which is why this observation is being reported. No sound associated with the object was observed. However, it must be added that the intersection where the UFO was seen is a busy place, which may have drowned out the object&#39;s possible sound emission.",

There were bright lights in front and on both sides, but I didn&#39;t hear a sound, it was completely silent. Then the lights went out and I saw that there was no rotor above, or anything below the body. It hung in the air for quite a while, and then it moved towards the center of Munkebo without a sound before it disappeared behind some trees. The color looked to me to be dark grey, and it could be approx. 5 meters wide in diameter.",

It catches my attention as it is clearly a metal. I take out my phone to take a picture and poof it&#39;s gone. The object was completely still in the air and I believe it was about 300m up in the air. It was round/oval in shape, actually very classic UFO looking.",

The height of the lower ones was just above the rooftops in front, probably 10 degrees or thereabouts, the highest ones maybe 30 degrees up. The distance was hard to judge, probably quite far away. No sound or movement. After a few minutes of observation, they disappeared one by one. At first I thought it was fireworks, a rocket, many flares or similar, but all the points remained completely stationary and the brightness did not vary at all, nor did the sounds of explosions. distribution in the pattern, only with significantly more and much stronger and larger reddish points of light.. They disappeared as mentioned above, one by one without a sound or variation in color, just &quot;turned off&quot;...",

As I get to the top of the hill on which the city sits, I see what I think is an aviator. I stop and roll down the window, because it flies low and much slower than the planes. It also does not light up green and red, but only orange. There is no sound. It just floats by silently. I recorded it on video, but the quality is not good at night. Think it must have been a meteor or similar, but still think it was moving too slowly for that.",

It was definitely not a plane or a shooting star. Pretty quickly I saw that it was heading straight for me - and the highway, and I sat and tried to figure out how to avoid it. Fortunately, it was not necessary, because it stopped directly above the motorway, slightly in front of me, so that I could now see it from the side - to the north. The light was turned off and there were only 2 very small lights, the rest was dark. I passed under it and couldn&#39;t spot it in the rear view mirror as I also had to keep an eye on where I was driving.",

        "content": "Have been enjoying the rising and almost full moon on a bench for a while and get on the bike and cycle home north on the path along the coast north of Egå Marina. Looking up at the Moon to the right as I cycle in the dark, but another phenomenon in motion catches my eye. An apparently round and completely silent orange light I detect to the north at an angle higher than 45 degrees moving directly towards the Moon, which is exactly in the east. The size, color and speed of the object is such that it arouses my interest even more, but I cycle in almost total darkness and have to concentrate a bit on seeing the path and choose to pass a short piece of forest of approx. 100 meters and then stop and follow the light after the piece of wood, expecting to see it &quot;under&quot; the Moon after the piece of wood, but now it&#39;s just gone!!! The following is a little hard to judge, but I would think that the orange light is the same dull color as a street lamp might be and quite a bit larger than the largest visible planets and quite a bit smaller than the Moon. Best guess for size and speed I can describe like this: 30 times bigger than a light from an airplane and 50 times smaller than the Moon and with a constant orange light. I have to describe the speed as much faster than a charter plane and much slower than a shooting star - and completely silent... What annoys me the most now is that I don&#39;t just stop and follow the light until it disappears or immediately find the mobile phone forth and films - just as I am quick to do when it e.g. is a squirrel in my hazel tree, stealing my hazelnuts and burying them in the lawn. It&#39;s just like I deny these experiences in heaven as something that didn&#39;t happen and I think I go into a state of shock/paralysis, but afterwards I&#39;m - like now - disappointed and annoyed with my own reaction or lack of together.... Am I alone in this experience? Otherwise, just write your observation of the same and, please, what happened to the orange light when passing the Moon, which it had the exact direction towards, when I absolutely had to cycle through the 10 second piece of forest... Did it burn out or did it land on the moon or what? Hope others can contribute - thanks!",

The time is approx. 22.38 and she says that something strange is flying in the sky just above. I look out into the open and see a strange object approx. 250 meters up approach the house. It flies directly west/east. The house is located exactly west/east. It is now twilight. The object is the same size as the cabin of a 2-person helicopter. It is elliptical, almost in the shape of a baseball and black-grey-metallic in color and without destinations. In front, a bright orange/red light flashes with a regular frequency, like the blinker on a car. It moves parallel to Kamstrupvej on the garden side of the houses with odd numbers. The speed is approx. 40-45 km. in class. Quickly, the object above my plot is right above and passes out towards Tårnvej and Copenhagen. There is absolutely no sound associated with the item. Just after it has passed, the red/orange light is no longer visible. The object is still visible, but already 10-15 sec. after the passage, difficult to see in the twilight. The wind speed was 0-2 meters per second and it was cloudy. Additional comments: I have never seen that type of light anywhere before and never in connection with anything technical. It is a light that you clearly remember. The object flew without slings in the roller and did not rotate. It followed like a stretched line. It looked like it was just passing the area and there was a clear destination ahead",

There was a hissing sound from the object which hung right above me for about 3-5 minutes. I tried to start the motorcycle but there was no ignition at all. Suddenly the light went out again and the hissing sound disappeared - towards the north (towards Fjerritslev, when I was standing at the Station building in Vust). As soon as the light and sound went away, the motorcycle started immediately when I stepped on the starter. The motorcycle was an NSU 125 cubic. Which I bought when I turned 18 and had just got my driver&#39;s license. At that time I was working for a farm owner in Thorup Holme. I have tried to explain to my family what I saw and was exposed to, but most shrug their shoulders and cannot understand the episode. Shortly after the experience, I drove the tractor past the Station building, and I have never had any doubts about my experience. For approx. 4 months ago I drove with my friend and her parents past the Station building and everything was still, as I experienced on the night of 31/12/1964 - I had at that time visited my girlfriend in Vesløs, and we had not drunk anything, so I was 100% sober.",

The observation started at about 10.10 p.m., when the object appeared in the night sky to the west (i.e. in the direction from Southern Langelandsbælt and the Småland Sea and moving in a rather easterly direction. The object was clearly visible for about 10/12 min., and a speed that was somewhat faster is assumed than an airplane. The height could be similar to that of a passenger plane, but there was 100% NO ENGINE NOISE (WIND QUIET) AND NO RED/GREEN NAVIGATION LIGHTS AND NO WHITE FLASHING LIGHTS. The object was equally clear from the front/sides and the back. It was PERFECT DEFINITELY not an airplane. But what could it be??? Several people have observed the object in the last few evenings at the same time/same route etc.",

        "content": "Vestergade is a steep hill that runs from Struer&#39;s torv to Holstebrovej. At the top of the street, Skolegade turns right. My friend and I were riding our mopeds up Vestergade from Torvet, when we spotted a large cigar-shaped object hanging over the street where Skolegade turns to the right. As we approached we could see that the object was circular and appeared to be flat. It hung motionless maybe 50 meters up and it was completely silent. It was like looking up at a flat lamp that glowed white-yellow. But the strange thing was that there was no visible light from it on the street. There were no details, just a flat white-yellow round disc, which we estimated to be at least 25 meters in diameter, but could easily have been twice that. When we got all the way up under the object, it began - still silently - to move slowly across Skolegade, and we naturally followed. But then it moved diagonally across the school towards Bjerggade, which runs parallel to Vestergade. Bjerggade has the same curved shape as Vestergade and also begins at Torvet and ends at Holstebrovej. But Bjergade has a slope on the right-hand side (when coming from Torvet) that goes down to Struer bay. When we almost reach Bjerggade, the object suddenly moves away with a speed that in a flash moves it beyond the summer house town of Bremdal, approx. one kilometer as the crow flies on the other side of Struer Bay. There it hangs again quietly for some time, after which it simply disappears. When we were talking the next day with a friend who lived on the corner at Bjergade, he told us that the night before he had seen something strange over the rooftops from the house&#39;s yard. Hence the additional witness in brackets. As I am now 70 years old, I think it is best to share my observation with you before it is lost. I was born in 1948 in the small village of Everdrup, halfway between Næstved and Præstø. When I was in the 4th grade, I entered a private school in Næstved, which is why I had to cycle to a small village Bøgesø and from there take the train to Næstved. On the road from Bøgesø to Everdrup there is a long, small settlement Flintemose and some forest, and after the 2 locations there is a free stretch with a long, steep hill, which everyone, adults and children, pulled their bikes up. The road is called Flintemosevej. A summer day in August or September 1959, on the way home from school, approx. at 14.45 plus/minus ½ hour, I thus pulled my bike up that hill. It was a lovely summer day without a cloud in the sky. When I had reached 2/3 up the hill, I looked back and saw some of my mates who had just arrived at the foot of the hill and were getting off their bikes. Approx. 15 sec. later I absentmindedly looked up at the sky to the north and suddenly saw a giant pipe in the sky. It was completely shiny and completely smooth without any openings etc. protrusion to see. The ends were blunt, and it seems to me that the ends were a little narrower than the middle. There were no sounds to be heard from it, and there was no smoke or electricity. fire out of the object. I looked at the object for 2-3-4 seconds, then turned my head to see if my companions had seen it too, but apparently they hadn&#39;t, so I quickly turned my head back and looked up at the sky again - but now the object was gone! I looked all over the sky, but there was no sign of it in the completely cloudless sky. And there were no other things to see either. It is obviously difficult to judge the size of the object as there was nothing in the sky to compare it to, but from how clear and sharp I saw it I would guess it was 3-400m away and as big as 2 jumbo jets. But the size is of course uncertain. However, I perceived it as very large and as a good distance away. Did it fly while I was watching it? I have often thought about that afterwards - but I don&#39;t actually know. IF it flew, it came approx. from the east in the longitudinal direction of the object. It had a slightly inclined position in the sky. The sighting probably happened many years ago, but I think I remember it as if it had happened a month ago. I can thus also remember who I follow. told about it, their names and what they answered me. I&#39;m not aware of anyone else seeing it.",

        "content": "At approx. 2 on the night of Saturday 21/7 I observe a red-yellow-green flickering light approx. 3 km. from my place of residence in Fraugde with a direction over Odense in a westerly direction. I would estimate the height to be approx. 500 m. The object emits an irregular flashing colored light, like the colors in a prism. At first I thought it must be a helicopter, but the small ones move quickly. which the object did. could not be derived from such. I observe the object for 30 minutes, during which my wife also sees the object &quot;flipping&quot; back and forth in the night sky with changing positions. After that I take my car to drive over towards the object. When I get to a high point close to my estimated position for the object, I climb out to find the light again. Unfortunately I can no longer see anything and want to drive again. Suddenly a white light appears in the sky very close to me (my estimate is about 500 m.) and in the area where I observed the colored light. The white light has the character of a &quot;giant flashlight&quot;, where the cone of light is turned from the north and down on me, but not so that the ground was illuminated. I figured now it HAS to be a plane, but as the light is facing me, it is significantly stronger than light from any plane. The light &quot;points&quot; at me for a moment, then turns up and away to the south. Unfortunately, there is no activity at this location at 02.30, so there are no further witnesses to the sighting.",

During a conversation I suddenly see 2 white lights moving next to each other from left to right. Almost synchronously... They are approx. 40 degrees in the direction of the west, with approx. 2 finger widths apart, and moves calmly across the sky with a speed reminiscent of normal airplanes. At first I think it&#39;s 2 planes, but they&#39;re almost too bright and there&#39;s no sound at all. Suddenly one changes direction downwards and perhaps to the south, while at the same time it starts to light up VERY strongly! From being something that resembles a large moving star in the sky, it fades to a size that corresponds to a protruding 1 crown! It almost blinds me and still no sound. Its &quot;inflated&quot; size lasts for a little over a second, after which it changes back to its original size. We didn&#39;t have time for a camera, the whole thing took approx. 20 seconds. There were no flashing lights, just 2 steady white lights that flashed up and down again in connection with their &quot;dive&quot;. The light was perfectly white. No shade of red, yellow or anything. Probably the most beautiful white light I have ever seen. We still find it very very mysterious and amazing to say the least. We are neither pilots nor scientists, but we simply cannot associate the 2 lights with anything we know of or can explain.",

It moves to the northeast and then moves back to the northwest at a seemingly steady pace. I wonder and continue along the central workshop, where it is not visible to me as I pass the workshop. When I get past the workshop and out to Linderupvej, I take out my iPhone 12max and film it as it moves back towards the northeast. I will then try to film something with a foreground to be able to judge the size, distance, etc. and put the phone down and want to start over, but when I pick up the phone again it&#39;s gone. When I look at the film and take still pictures of it, it shows an elongated cylindrical object with one end rounded and the other end apparently flat. I have no idea of size at all, but in the picture you can see a shadow on the lower half of the thing, so immediately it must have been lower than the sun was out in the east at 07.45 to be able to make the shadow? I think it hung over the fjord.",

In shape they seemed triangular and they followed as if they were in formation next to each other. We followed them for approx. 5-10 seconds, after which the northernmost, in a very sharp turn, turned to the northwest. In a very short time, all three of them disappeared. It looked like they were flying out into the atmosphere at very high speed. There must definitely be more among the approx. 1000 spectators who have seen the same thing, and I can say with certainty that it was not a plane, the speed was too high for that and the change of direction that one made was far too sharp.",

        "content": "What I saw that February morning has been playing in my mind ever since. I&#39;m not a guy who believes in EVERYTHING between heaven and earth. I have an open mind and I am not so arrogant to think that we should be the only ones in the entire universe. I sat that morning and enjoyed the light that was growing. I can see the sea and the Hirsholms from my living room window. The sea was almost black and the lower horizon was bright yellow. Above the low yellow horizon was a belt of medium dark clouds, and above that a third belt which was even darker. There was light above. I saw something moving on the horizon. There is a flagpole, so on the fly I thought it was an early flag, or one that hadn&#39;t been taken down the day before. But then it hit me. There was absolutely no wind that could make a flag stand completely rectangular. So I go to the window and take a closer look. A rectangle slightly larger than a large flag moved slowly up and down between the light belts I have described. Then slanted up over to the east a few times and then went back to the starting point. Then it went straight up above the 3rd belt and moved in an eastward direction, where it stopped half hidden behind a low-hanging white cloud. It stayed there for a moment, then slowly disappeared. All movements were very slow and it was like watching a large piece of plastic. Sorry I&#39;m not good enough with my PC so I could send a picture seen from my window. But I swear! WHAT I saw WAS something. I do not know what. Maybe a hologram, but in any case not an expression of my imagination. I will always wonder about THAT. I hope that it is a useful input in your work, and I would really like to hear if you have heard of similar incidents.",

It disappears behind some tall buildings and I can no longer see it. It disappears to the south. It follows the firmament. I would say it is round and about the size of a 1/4 full moon as it is directly above me. My camera is a regular little one called Caplio R6 with 7.1x optical wide zoom.

When I look up at it, it quickly disappears into the sky at a 90 degree angle and disappears. It lasts no more than 4-5 seconds, but I have no idea what it was, only that it was neither the Moon nor a shooting star. I will shoot it to be a few meters in diameter and it moved away again in a flash. It was cloudless and warm that day, so ball lightning also seems unlikely. When I get home 30 sec. later, there is nothing to see in the sky and I rush in and tell my husband. It is inexplicable what it could have been.",

We live in a private cooperative housing with 20 semi-detached houses. The roof ridge is approx. 5.5 meters, and I stood approx. 10-12 meters from the neighboring house - and didn&#39;t want to include the neighbour&#39;s roof in the photo, which is why I &quot;aimed&quot; over their roof - and I don&#39;t know how to calculate degrees above the horizon, but would think it is approx. 45 degrees. I didn&#39;t notice anything at all when I took the photo - but when I looked at the photo I noticed a black spot. I thought it was probably some dirt on the lens, but couldn&#39;t see anything and therefore took a photo inside the living room - and there wasn&#39;t a black spot on that photo. Thought &quot;well the bad lens&quot; is obviously gone. So this morning I came to look at the photo again - and suddenly thought that something called &quot;effects&quot; had appeared on my IPhone, among other things. something called a loop - where fractions of seconds before and after the actual photo are included. AND then suddenly I could see that the spot came flying at a very high speed - CAN I POSSIBLY SEND MY PHOTO / LOOP ??",

Around 18-19/1-12 I drive to our house at 7pm and see a large circular light source orange/yellow coming flying towards my direction of travel. I would guess the light source is approx. 100-150 meters above the ground. At first I think it is a plane, but there is no sound and no other light on it. When I first see it, it is approx. 500 meters from our house. I drive to the house and get out of the car to observe it. It is about 150 meters from our house and 100-150 meters above the ground. There is no sound at all and it moves quietly and smoothly in a smooth motion. When it is approx. 50-80 meters past our house, it stands still for a few seconds and then starts to move out over the water, and then it is as if it accelerates violently for approx. 10 seconds it disappears into nothingness and finally disappears completely. The entire observation lasted approx. 2 minutes For this sighting, I was the only one who saw it - the next one was seen by both me and my wife. This took place on the same day as in Malling - namely on 12/2-12 at around 10 p.m. My wife and I are sitting on the sofa watching TV when Janne (my wife) spots a light approx. 50 meters above the ground around the neighbour&#39;s house. We rush to the window, and then I spot the same light source that I saw around the 18th-19th. January. A glowing circle/ball in orange/yellow. We only observe it for approx. 8-10 seconds before it disappears. So on Tuesday 14/2-12 my wife observes it again. This happens in the evening around 22.25 when she comes home from a visit to her mother. She sees it again when she comes driving towards our house. Again it is above our neighbor&#39;s house hovering from west to east. She rushes in and calls to me, but when we come out together it is gone. I am very interested to hear if anyone else has observed anything similar during this period. The reason I am writing is, among other things, the video on your website and have just read about a person in Hjørrin,g who experienced something similar in January.",

It doesn&#39;t fly away. One moment it&#39;s there and the next it&#39;s just gone. On our route further I looked to see if it reappeared, but it didn&#39;t.",

It is NOT the moon or other man-made light sources, as my cottage is very secluded. To me, the light cones form an angle of approx. 30 degrees above the ground.",

        "content": "I stand on our stepping stones facing our garden and look up at an almost cloudless evening sky. I first observe a slow moving object flying at a speed of approx. like an aviator. It flies from south to north. At first I think it is a satellite, although it flies significantly slower than satellites normally do. But after 3-5 seconds the object starts to increase in brightness. In approx. 2 seconds, the brightness rises from the brightness of one of the stars drawing the Great Bear to the brightness of Venus in the morning!! I now think I&#39;m seeing a bolide, (powerful shooting star) which I&#39;ve seen before, but this one is just flying way too slow!?, also it doesn&#39;t end up exploding or ending abruptly in a flash of light like bolides often do does, instead the brightness decreases quickly after 1-2 seconds and continues with a weaker brightness than when I spotted it, then it flies on for approx. 5 seconds and disappears. During the entire observation, the object maintains the same speed and speed and extends over approx. 5 degrees in the sky (equivalent to a clenched fist). I have often observed the night sky (amateur astronomer) and am familiar with most natural or human light phenomena, from bolides to twinkling Russian satellites, etc., but I have never experienced anything that behaved like what I saw last night. I am therefore also happy that I found this page on the internet relatively quickly, and I hope that you will be able to give me an answer to my observation.",

We hurriedly got dressed and went down to the beach and observed them. They were out on the open sea, flying back and forth and diving into the sea. Every time they came up from the water they lit up completely. White.

At first I thought it was a plane, but it didn&#39;t flash the light like it would have done, and it was also now flying too slowly to be a shooting star. The light started out white, but then it turned blue, then turquoise green, then green, then yellow and back to turquoise green. It flew from north to south very quietly, but suddenly it stopped in the middle of the sky. It hung there for about five seconds and then flew at a very high speed to the west until I could no longer see it because of the buildings.

Right after that, 4 orange lights come that fly in a rhombus shape and finally there is a single orange light. They fly slower than an airplane and there is no noise. I drive up to Vittenbjergbakken to have a closer look, but already there, the 4 that flew in a rhombus shape have almost &quot;disappeared&quot;. It almost seems as if they are spinning, so the light dims and eventually disappears completely. I did, however, film the last bit with my phone, although it is difficult to see anything. My suspicion goes to those Chinese hot air balloons, but not anyway, as they flew very symmetrically.",

It is a large object, not at all comparable to drones and the like. Maybe 10 meters wide, maybe a little less. Below the bottom, red and green lights flashed. It was fairly flat in shape, and completely round, with light around the edge. In the light I could see that the object - or the edge - was rotating rapidly. I couldn&#39;t see how it could fly.

I went to a large skylight and saw that a bright orb of light, berstone colored, yellow probably had passed over the house. The ball of light was for approx. 200 meters high and quite large. It moved south until it was about 1.5 km from the house and became stationary under the cloud cover for a few minutes. After a few minutes it began to move just as quietly in a westerly direction. The static electricity decreased after the ball of light was approx. 500 meters from the property and then slowed down. I am a hobby astronomer and quite well informed about cognitive processes. I cannot immediately give an explanation for the phenomenon.",

Driving from Holsted town, and just after the roundabout meets a large tractor with wagon. Sees that it is my neighbour&#39;s helper in the tractor, and greets as I overtake. Continue approx. 150 meters, and then sees a helicopter in the sky, it flies from west to east. But then I see something slanting below, a little further to the east, and it&#39;s moving west, but much slower. At first I think it might be a glider at that speed. I look more while driving the car and can&#39;t spot any wings. It is just a (beam) round at the ends and white and completely defined. Then I realize that it must be a UFO. I now have to turn into where I live, so I do, but stay just inside the road and rush out of the car to stand and observe. The helicopter has flown somewhat further east, but it (white bar) is only slowly heading west. At the same time, the neighbor&#39;s helper comes driving and wants to go in where I am with the car, and I have to drive away so he can get there. I point up to the sky twice and hope he has also seen the UFO then. I get into the car and hurry to drive home. Approx. 50 meters. Then I run around the garden, all I can. Out into the field, where I can see from west to east, but it was too late, there was no sign of anything in the sky. Then I run over to the neighbor to see if I can find the helper. I found him and asked him if he had seen it. But he had seen nothing. Although I had pointed up to the sky twice. However, he had seen that. It was a shame he hadn&#39;t seen it. But I&#39;m glad to have experienced it, and if it hadn&#39;t been for the helicopter, I probably wouldn&#39;t have seen it either.",

The object maintains a constant speed across the sky to the east. There is absolutely NO sound associated with the object. The light intensity is strongest from the front. There is no economic pattern to be seen. The light intensity is constant, but very similar to a &quot;yellow flame&quot; from a fire. First thought was. A jet plane. BUT it can&#39;t fit with the fluxuring light intensity FROM THE FRONT !! There were no &quot;windows&quot; to be seen or anything else that might suggest that it might be a plane. It was cloudy. The &quot;base&quot; probably hangs around 2-400 meters above the clouds. Clearly, the object moved its UNDER the base. Observes the object as it disappears in an easterly direction. Oddly enough, almost the same path that planes will travel from Århus towards Tirstrup Airport, but still not quite. But I want to emphasize that there was absolutely NO sound (jet sound, propeller sound, rumble, hiss or anything else) to notice. Speed on object. Hard to judge, but around 3-400 km/h I would think. The object disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. Like but putting out a fire.",

I go back to the driveway and the lights follow. After this I go down to the neighboring property by a 200 m long country road. The object is included. Along the way I try to run a bit, but after a short moment the object catches up with me again. After that I go back again and it comes with it. As I continue around the backyard, the object still follows. I go inside to see if it can be seen from inside the house, but it&#39;s gone when I get inside. I go out again but it&#39;s gone.",
